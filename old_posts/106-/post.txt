Text: It seems to go without saying in today's world that a solid brand and strong visual identity are the easiest ways to stand out among your peers.  At LainLee3Design, it is always my goal to help my clients achieve just that with every graphic endeavor I undertake.  I believe in creating solid, long-lasting relationships with my clients, not juicing up my portfolio, and coming up with innovative ways to connect them with their target markets.  I pride myself on being able to truly listen to what it is my clients are seeking to achieve and working with them to custom-craft their project to take their brand to the next level.  LainLee3Design is a brand-centric design company, where I believe developing a strong brand and visual identity is tantamount to being "trendy" or coming up with a quick gimmick.  I strive to help my clients develop visual identities that will have longevity and mainstay, giving them a competitive edge to help them make an incredible impression.

With that being said, I am very pleased to announce that LainLee3Design is now offering several exciting new design "packages" for corporate identity and, my personal fave, Indie T-Shirt Lines.  These packages come at three different levels of complexity and detail, offering price breaks to accommodate businesses and entrepreneurs at various budgetary stages.  I'm especially excited about the packages for Indie T-Shirt lines, which offers 3 new packages for The Noob, those that have Been In the Game, and those that are Here to Stay.  Check out the packages below, and click on the "Inquire Now" links to get started with your custom design packages.  Please note that all designs are custom-tailored to match your business or clothing line.  No design elements are duplicated or recycled for other projects, and no templates are used.  You get nothing but 100%, custom-crafted, quality design!
