Text: This week I had the privilege of developing a logo for my man Nate from <a href="http://candyeffectclothing.com/" target="_blank">Candy Effect Clothing</a>, for his new business, Foams4U.  Nate makes some amazing die-cut foam cut outs of high-quality artwork, which works great from signage at events and for point-of-purchase displays!  You can see some of the freshness he cranked out for our brand <a href="http://shop.lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">IIIShirts®</a> earlier this week below.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_3095.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1894" title="IMG_3095" src="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/IMG_3095-614x614.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="553" /></a></p>
What really impressed me about Nate was not only the quality of his product (the foam cut outs are really dope), but also the quality of his customer service.  As mentioned in my <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/new-mailers-are-in" target="_blank">previous post</a>, I'm a stickler for customer service and Nate delivered above and beyond that!  Not only did he get my order right on time, not only was the quality of the product superior, but he went above the call and delivered some extra goodies with the cutouts (see those dope stickers and smaller cut outs?), which REALLY impressed me!  And that's what will keep you going back to a company for future work and orders - quality products and quality customer service.  That's the standard of excellence I expect of myself for LainLee3Design and <a href="http://shop.lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">IIIShirts®</a>, and therefore, that's the standard I expect others to strive to meet or surpass.

For the logo, Nate wanted something fun, fresh and playful that encapsulated what the business was all about.  He knew three things: (1) He wanted some sort of character; (2) That character needed to have on it the tools utilized by Nate for Foams4U; and (3) The character had to be rockin' fresh kicks! (Done and done)  With that very awesome creative brief and boundless creative freedom otherwise, we developed the logo you see above for Nate's business.  His immediate reaction was, "It's perfect!" and with that, Foams4U had a new face!!!

While Nate finishes getting things in order on the website tip, you can check out his work on Instagram by following <em><strong>@foams4u</strong></em>!  Expect to see some LL3Dsn artwork on his page soon too, teehee! :D
