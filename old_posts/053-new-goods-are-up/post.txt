Text: Greetings earthlings!  It's been a busy week here at LainLee3Design, a healthy mix of client work, promo projects and personal projects.  Basically, I've been pen-tooling like a BEAST!!!  But it's been fun, it's something I prayed I'd get more time to do and now I'm doing it so, I'm thankful!  Plus, I love vectors and the pen tool, and giving my art that finished look!  So the following is a summary of "My Week in Vectors":

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">"Drive" Movie Fan Poster PRE-ORDER</span></strong></span>

If you haven't seen Drive yet, I honestly don't know what to say.  I don't want to say that you're sleeping on possibly one of the dopest revenge stories of our time, because that'd build it up way too much and kill your excitement.  But then again, I don't want to tell you the truth that you're a horrible person for denying yourself the occular pleasure of this visual masterpiece either...so all I'll say is this - if you haven't seen it yet, go see it THIS WEEKEND!  Take a special someone and go!!!

In honor of this awesome piece of cinema, I decided to make a fan poster, featuring Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan and Ron Pearlman, commemorating their roles in the movie.  I was thrilled to find out it was added to the official Facebook page for the movie, which you can see <a href="http://on.fb.me/q4IVKM" target="_blank">here</a>.  I also have the print available for PRE-ORDER up in my online store.  It is a LIMITED EDITION 11x17" print, limited to 25 pcs (well, 23 now), each numbered and signed by yours truly.  A great addition to have to your movie art collection.  Order yours now: <a href="http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com/product/drive-fan-poster-pre-order" target="_blank">http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com/product/drive-fan-poster-pre-order</a>

<span style="font-size: medium; color: #2296df;"><strong>"Fresh Type" Art Print</strong></span>

My "Fresh Type" piece is finally finished!  I started this piece back in January and have maybe revisited it once or twice since then.  But it wasn't until this week when that spark of inspiration struck and I was able to finish it the way I'd always envisioned...and some.  Originally, it was just going to be a promo piece.  But at the request of a few fans, it is now available in the store also as a LIMITED EDITION 11x17" Poster Print, limited to 25 pcs (only 22 left).  Each comes signed and numbered by me.  Be sure to cop yours today: <a href="http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com/product/fresh-type-print" target="_blank">http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com/product/fresh-type-print</a>

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">LainLee3Design Promo Stickers</span></strong></span>

Finally had the time to finalize some designs I've been working on for some new promo stickers coming soon for LainLee3Design.  Each design will be about 4-5" wide and die-cut.  I'll be using these to hand out at events, place in orders from the III Store, or sticker bob-omb on the street!  Check them out below, let me know what you think!
