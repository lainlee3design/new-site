Text: This week, our new poly mailers for our brand, <a href="http://shop.lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">IIIShirts®</a>, arrived from <a href="http://www.monstermashpress.com/" target="_blank">MNSTRMSH®</a>!!!  I discovered Monster Mash randomly through someone's Tumblr post a few weeks ago and decided to send them an inquiry.  I was pleased to see a response from the owner, Manny, in my inbox the next morning.  After exchanging a few emails covering logistics and details, my payment and artwork were off to <a href=" http://www.monstermashpress.com/" target="_blank">MNSTRMSH®</a> within the course of a few days.  A week later, here they are and they look gorgeous!

Manny and his team did a fantastic job!  The best part about the whole experience, especially for someone like me who's a stickler for quality and experience, was the customer service!  Manny always made sure to respond to my emails in a timely manner and never skimped on the details.  He was always professional and thorough and I greatly appreciate that, especially when working with a new company.  That's what I expect of myself for IIIShirts® and LainLee3Design, and that's the standard of quality we strive to achieve in our products and services, so naturally I expect no less from others. With that said, <a href="http://monstermashpress.com" target="_blank">MNSTRMSH®</a> met every expectation swimmingly!

Big ups to Manny and the good folks at <a href="http://www.monstermashpress.com/" target="_blank">MNSTRMSH®</a> for the excellent job they did, and greatly look forward to working with them again on future projects and orders!

If you wanna see the amazing work they did for us, head on over to the <a href="http://shop.lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">IIIStore™</a> and pick up a IIIShirt® from our current summer line, "Fix Up! Look Sharp!"  Your order will come in one of our fresh new poly mailers!
