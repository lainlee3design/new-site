Text: This is a post I've been wanting to do for a while now.  As a freelance professional and solopreneur (go ahead, feel free to use it ;P), it is entirely necessary for you to be able to wear many different hats to ensure that your business runs efficiently.  You have to be the customer service rep, accountant, manager, designer, photographer, marketer...the list goes on.  Therefore, it is important that you research and explore your options of finding services that help you stay organized and manage your multitude of responsibilities efficiently and effectively.

There are many services out there to choose from when it comes to project management, accounting and bookkeeping, invoicing, time tracking, online file storage, and social networking.  What's important is that you don't allow yourself to get intimidated by the shear number of options.  But instead, take a DEEP breath, sit back, and patiently begin to sift through the options, trying each one on for size, until you've found a keeper.  You are the only one who knows what's best for your business and what your business needs to flourish and prosper.  Therefore, you can't rely on anyone else to tell you what services you should use for your company - you have to take the initiative to find the right fit for yourself.  Now I'm not saying it's bad to listen to suggestions (I should think this whole post would be pointless in that case).  But just remember that ultimately, it's up to you to decide which services are right for your business.

In the course of my career, I've tried MANY different services to help me manage my plethora of different responsibilities.  Some worked, others didn't; some were keepers, others weren't.  There were those that were perfect for me at the beginning, but as my business grew, so too did my needs outgrow their capability.  Then there were those that were just too big for me at the beginning, but are just right for me now!  And I'm sure, as time goes on, I will have to move on from my current services and find others that fit my future criteria.

The following list is a collection of the online services and apps (both desktop and smartphone) that I currently use to help me stay organized and manage my business properly.

<a href="http://37signals.com"><strong>Basecamp</strong></a>: I've tried several different project management services over the years, and for me, can't nobody do it like the folks over at 37signals!  I LOVE Basecamp and the capabilities it has.  So far, no other P.M. service has allowed me to share content or communicate with clients as easily as Basecamp.  The interface and navigation are very user friendly; every single client that I've had use Basecamp has never had a single complaint with using it and they have always been able to pick it up with the greatest of ease.

<a href="http://roninapp.com"><strong>Ronin</strong></a>: Invoicing is one of those things that I should have been doing from the start, but really have only got around to in the past few years or so.  In that amount of time, I've tried a dozen different apps and online services - everything from Freshbooks to Billings, and NOTHING seemed to work for me.  Either the interface was too confusing or the design of the invoices was too juvenile, nothing seemed to match the feel of my business.  Then along came Ronin, and it was love at first click!  Everything about Ronin is right for me - the price point, the interface, the capability, and the design of the invoices, estimates, and bills.  If you're in search of a fresh-looking, easy-to-use, impress-your-friends online invoicing/time-tracking service, look no further than Ronin.

<a href="http://www.billsonyourtable.com/"><strong>Bills</strong></a>: I have a HORRIBLE memory, and when you spend all of your time in front of the computer for 12 hrs a day, you tend to lose track of things pretty easily, especially time.  If you don't pay attention, before you know it you're behind on payments and the late fees or penalties just start adding up (it's actually never been THAT bad, but it could've been).  So for me, the solution was an app that allowed me to enter all of my bills and set automatic reminders days ahead of payment.  Bills was that app.

<strong><a href="http://paypal.com">PayPal™</a></strong>: Say what you will, but I'm a big PayPal fan, though I'm not a HUGE fan of their ridiculous fees.  But receiving money is quick, easy and secure, and pretty much every service allows you to make or receive payments.  Their iPhone app is clean and easy to use and allows you to receive Push Notifications when you receive money.

<strong><a href="http://squareup.com">Square</a></strong>: Square may very well soon be the PayPal killer.  It's simple: sign up for Square and they'll send you their Square Credit Card reader free of charge!  Verify your bank account with them, and POP POP!, you're ready to start accepting credit card payments directly to your bank account.  Their fees are a little better than PayPal, but it's in your best interest to swipe a customer's or client's card if they have it (the fees are higher for non-swipe transactions).  A great tool to have for tradeshows or events where you're selling merch!

<a href="http://actionmethod.com"><strong>Action Method</strong></a>: Scott Belsky and his team have truly created something unique with their Behance Network of services.  His book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-Obstacles/dp/159184312X">"Making Ideas Happen"</a>, has truly been an inspiration to myself and my colleagues (you know who you are).  We as creative people are told that we're inherently disorganized people, incapable of following through with our ideas.  While this may be true, it is by no means an inherent quality that all creative people must suffer from.  By learning the Action Method, we can overcome disorganized tendencies and learn how to see ideas through from conception to inception.  The Action Method website may be a companion to the book but is another great project management/idea repository for you and your team (or colleagues) to use.

<a href="http://twitter.com/lainlee3design"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>:  I was SO against Twitter when it first came out and everyone was making a big deal about it.  I just didn't see the value in following some random celebrity and hearing about the banana they just ate.  But as the twitt-o-sphere grew and matured, I started to see its value in helping your business grow.  As a freelancer, I've worked with clients from around the world, from India to the UK, from Canada to Australia.  But with Twitter, my network has only continued to grow at an accelerated rate.  My advice: utilize Twitter for it's marketing and business connection resources.  It's a great way to expand your business.  But never just jump on the bandwagon for the sake of being in the know!  And that goes for anything!  Be an individual with individual thoughts, and only do things when they feel right and work for YOU!

Well, that's it for now!  I hope you've found this list helpful and have more of a foundation when trying to find the services that work best for you.  There are plenty of websites you can go for more comprehensive lists, the two that come to mind offhand are <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/resources-directory/">FreelanceSwitch.com</a> and <a href="http://mac.appstorm.net/">Appstorm</a>.  But please leave me some feedback, let me know what you thought of this post!  Or if you have any other services that have worked great in helping you grow your business, list them here and let the rest of us know!

Peace. L3.
