Text: Great motivational short film created by the good folks at Behance.net.  It's a great insight to the creative process, and the expectations put on creatives from clients and ourselves.  You can read the  "manifesto" from the video below.  I'm not quite sure if this is the entire "documentary" or just a trailer, but either way it's a great glimpse for clients and potential clients.

Behind every great advancement, in every industry, there is a creative mind.

Creativity may come easy, but creation is hard.

The late nights spent trying, and failing, and trying again.

All the while, holding onto our vision.
Pushing what we see in our mind's eye into the world.

But our brilliance is being held captive by forces around us and within us.

Middle men who play us down while marking us up.
Not giving us credit. Getting us to work for free.

And worse, we get in the way of our own success.
We rely on chance encounters. We’re disorganized and isolated, liable to go unnoticed.

We can do better.

When creative minds come together, the sum exceeds all expectations.
We connect, we learn, we critique, and we prosper.

It's not about money or fame, it's about doing what we love.

It's about creating our greatest work on our own terms.
It’s about realizing that creativity is not just an opportunity - it's a responsibility.

Here's to unleashing our full potential.
For us, and for the world that awaits what we will do next; Take creative control.
