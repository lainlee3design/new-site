Text: Came across this AWESOME recreation of the old Hanna-Barbera Johnny Quest opening titles by Roger D. Evans.  As a kid, my family spent two years in Italy, and as a kid in a foreign country, the only thing besides fast food to make you truly feel at home are cartoons.  Unfortunately, the first year we were without TV, well, at least TV in English.  Year two however, we were able to get a dish, but the only broadcasts we could get was Boomerang via The Cartoon Network in the UK.  What did they play?  Vintage Hanna-Barbera cartoons all day everyday 24-7-365!  So I became VERY familiar with the likes of Johnny Quest, Thundar the Barbarian, the Herculoids, Birdman, Space Ghost, Blue Falcon and Dynomutt, Penelope Pitstop, Snagglepuss, the Jetsons, the Flintstones, Yogi Bear...ugh, I could go on and on.

Anywho, all that was to say that I really enjoyed seeing this recreated and updated!  The only thing that still tops it is the 1996 incarnation of the franchise, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Q7nKNVPwc" target="_blank">The Real Adventures of Johnny Quest</a>.
