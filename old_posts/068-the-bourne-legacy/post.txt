Text: Well, it's official, and our worst fears are officially confirmed - Matt Damon is NOT going to be in the next Bourne franchise film.  The fourth installment, The Bourne Legacy, will star Jeremy Renner, who in my opinion is a little too intense and disingenuous - not to play the role of Kenneth Kitsome, a new subject from Project Outcome (he's not playing Jason Bourne), but just to pick up where Damon left off.  Since <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339030/" target="_blank">Paul Greengrass</a> expressed that he wasn't interested in directing any more Bourne movies, Bourne writer-turned-director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006904/">Tony Gilroy</a> is manning the helm of this part of the Bourne series, and explains that Renner is not replacing Damon, but that instead, this is opening a whole new chapter in the franchise.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The easiest way to think of it is an expansion or a reveal … Jason Bourne will not be in this film, but he’s very much alive. What happened in the first three films is the trigger for what happens. I’m building a legend and an environment and a wider conspiracy…the world we’re making enhances and advances and invites Jason Bourne’s return [down the road].”</p>
Matt Damon's performances as Jason Bourne invited you as the viewer into his world, and was able to balance the intensity of his inner struggle with the fact that he was inherently a good person.  But who knows, we have yet to see what Mr. Renner will bring to the table.  I'm more excited for him to appear as Hawkeye in <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/marvels-avengers-extended-trailer">The Avengers</a> than as Kenneth Kitsome.  But I'm not going to hate, we shall see Mr. Renner...we shall see.  What do you think?
