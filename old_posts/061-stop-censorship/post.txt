Congress is considering two well-intentioned but deeply flawed bills, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112s968rs/pdf/BILLS-112s968rs.pdf">PROTECT-IP Act</a> and the <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf">Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)</a>.

As written, they would betray more than a decade of US policy and advocacy of Internet freedom by establishing a censorship system using the same domain blacklisting technologies pioneered by China and Iran.

As the final true frontier of free expression and sharing, we need to protect our right to share things on the internet!  Those who commit online fraud and piracy will be caught, but those of us using the internet for creative or expressive purposes, or to even conduct business, SHOULD NOT be held responsible!!!  Spread the word and do not let this stand!!!
