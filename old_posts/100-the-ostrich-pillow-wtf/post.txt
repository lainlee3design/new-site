Text: While perusing the random awesomeness that is <a href="http://theawesomer.com" target="_blank">The Awesomer</a> tonight, I came across this contraption and seriously could NOT stop laughing!  What was designed to be a way for you to grab a quick, personal and private power nap (and apparently increase your productivity by 34%), will undoubtedly, IF FUNDED, become the EASIEST way for you to get beat senseless and mugged for every valuable on your person or have the ultimate prank pulled on you!  Whether in the airport, school library, office or taking public transportation, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ostrich-pillow/ostrich-pillow" target="_blank">The Ostrich Pillow</a> takes all of the fun out of thieving!  Sorry robbers, muggers and rapists, but these idiots just had to rain on your parade!  For the love of God, PLEASE don't let this absurd contraption get funded!  But who am I kidding?  With 13,233 likes on Facebook and 544 backers already with 23 days left to go...it's gonna get funded.
