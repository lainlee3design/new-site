Text: <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/" target="_blank">Rockstar Games</a> has been on straight fiyah lately.  From GTA IV to Red Dead Redemption, they're definitely maturing in not only their gameplay, but also their storytelling abilities and character development.  And after spending years making games about outlaws on the wrong side of the law, Rockstar is turning over a new leaf, and finally releasing a game where you get to put away those deplorable criminals in the name of justice.

Set in an eight square mile block of a historically accurate 1940s Los Angeles, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/adventure/lanoire/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>L.A. NOIRE</strong></a> follows a young officer who has just returned home from WWII.   Starting out as a patrol officer, <strong>L.A. NOIRE</strong> allows you to make decisions as you solve crimes in a "choose your own adventure" style of gameplay that let you work your way up through the force, from traffic detective all the way up to homicide.   Vividly detailed with cutting-edge mocap technology for the facial animations of the characters and actors, <strong>L.A. NOIRE</strong> does an amazing job of capturing life in the 1940s City of Angels and recreating historical and often horrific crime scenes.   With more than a cheeky nod to film noire, this is looking to be another epic title in terms of story, characters, and attention to detail from Rockstar.
