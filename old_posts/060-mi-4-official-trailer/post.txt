Text: 2011 has been a HUGE year for movies so far: Thor, Captain America, Green Lantern, Drive, with many more blockbusters to hit theaters before the year's out.  But no movie, I repeat, NO movie looks as AMAZINGLY EPIC to me as Brad Bird's first live-action film, Mission Impossible 4: Ghost Protocol!!!  You may know of Brad Bird from Pixar fame, where he directed such classics as Ratatouille, The Iron Giant and The Incredibles. With an all-star cast featuring Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton, Tom Wilkinson and Josh Holloway, and explosive action from beginning to sizzling end, this movie looks absolutely amazing!!!

The official theatrical trailer just dropped today! Take a look, and make sure you have a fresh pair of undies to change into afterward, it's guaranteed to cause a little pittle-age!!!
