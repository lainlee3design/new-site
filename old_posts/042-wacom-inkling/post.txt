Text: As an illustrator living in a digital world, I've yet to find a digital sketchpad, stylus or program that gives me the same tactile pleasure of drawing with pen-in-hand on my favorite sketchpad!  That being said, the new <a href="http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Inkling" target="_blank">Wacom Inkling</a> ($200) looks like it could very well be the answer to my problem. It includes a small receiver that attaches to any sketchbook or normal piece of paper and an electronic sketch pen that work together to record your sketches stroke-by-stroke, which can then be transferred over USB and into Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketchbook Pro, or any number of traditional image formats.  The technology sounds promising, and I like the idea of there being one less step between sketching and vectorizing my illos, but I'm still of the school of only being fully convinced when I've test-driven it myself.

What do you think?  Could the Wacom Inkling really be the answer to true digital drawing or will it fall short of delivering a true illustrator's experience?  Post your comments below!
