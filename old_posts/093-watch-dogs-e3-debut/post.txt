Text: Ubisoft continues to be one of my favorite developers, by continually putting out amazing games that deliver new game play experiences for the users, from Splinter Cell to the Assassin's Creed Franchise!  I was already excited about ACIII coming out later this year (I already pre-ordered it months ago).  But today their next big game was announced at E3 and I have to say, I'm not only blown away by the concept, I'm in love with the new physics engine their using (I wonder if it's the same Anvil Next Engine their using for ACIII).

Not much has been revealed about "Watch Dogs" yet, but Ubisoft released a great typography-driven motion video explaining the basis of the story, seen below.

The backstory starts in 2003, when a power outage left 55 million Americans in the dark.  The power outage was caused by a disgruntled employee who uploaded a virus that crippled the power grid on the east coast.  The government’s response was CTOS, a program that controls a city’s entire information network: the power grid, traffic grid, personal data networks, and everything else. CTOS controls the city, but also farms data on individuals. Who then controls CTOS? The player, of course.

The main character is a man named Aiden Pearce, a hacker who has access to all of the info CTOS compiles, and can pull up everyone’s personal data at will.  Not much else is revealed about Aiden, other than he has a score to settle and he's a bad-ass on a mission!

Check out the 9-minute, 44-second game demo below and determine for yourself whether how awesome the game looks!
