Text: After a long and arduous summer, I've decided to close down IIIShirts® to enjoy the rest of summer with my family.  It's been a great summer and we would like to thank <em><strong>EVERYONE</strong></em> who has supported us - to all of our customers, <a href="http://theblotsays.com" target="_blank">blogger friends</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/lainlee3design" target="_blank">Facebook</a> fans - thank you from the bottom of my heart!

If you have placed an order with us during the month of July, your order is currently being processed and will be shipping within the next week.  Thank you once again for your purchase and support of indie art &amp; the entrepreneurial spirit!

We hope everyone has a safe and exciting rest of summer!

Take care and God bless,
