Text: Recently I've been finding some really dope illustrators online.  Some are thanks to Ryan Putnam over at <a href="http://vectips.com" target="_blank">Vectips</a>, where every Friday he releases a collection of artwork in his "Weekly Inspiration" posts.  Others are thanks to Twitter.  It's really awesome to be inspired by other artists who've honed their craft so expertly it makes you jealous and excited at the same time!  But it's not a bad jealous, it's an inspirational jealousy; the kind that makes you want to better your own skills to a point where they too can one day be an inspiration to others.  One of these artists is a man by the name of Dayne Henry, Jr.

Dayne's illustration skills are amazing.  I first came across Dayne's work through a random search on Devianart.com, and I'm so thankful that I did.  His detail is uncanny and his characters are full of life, attitude, and personality.  There's something about his style that's reminiscent of some of my favorite comic books back in my childhood that I think I connect with.  All I know is that when I look at Dayne's artwork it always inspires me to pick up my pencil and sketch pad and just draw!  So thank you Dayne for being an inspiration.

We're going to try to get Dayne here on the Blllog™ in the near future for a little "Q&amp;A" session, but in the meantime, check Dayne out on <a href="http://romidion.deviantart.com/" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>, <a href="http://www.behance.net/DayneHenry" target="_blank">Behance</a>, or on his own site at <a href="http://romidion.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">http://romidion.blogspot.com/</a>.  You can also grab some of his very limited artwork in his <a href="http://daynehenry.bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">store</a>.  I just snagged this one-of-a-kind sketch he did of He-Man, Lion-O, and Link and have it hanging above my desk!  Sorry ;P
