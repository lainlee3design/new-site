Text: A new advert for Argentinian appliance store <a href="http://www.garbarino.com/">Garbarino</a> has hit the interwebz in an explosive way...from the FUTURE!  That's right, the ad, green-lit by Universal Studios, features Doctor Emmit Brown (aka "Doc") and his time-traveling DeLorean from the "Back to the Future" franchise.<br/><br/>

According to BTTF co-creator Bob Gale, who told the folks over at <a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a337332/back-to-the-future-commercials-may-continue-says-bob-gale.html">Digital Spy</a> that this may be the first in a series of adverts for Garbarino featuring the good Doc [played by the timeless Christopher Lloyd] and his time machine, however that has yet to be confirmed.  "I actually never saw a script for it, so I'm delighted you sent [the link] to me!" Gale told Digital Spy. "My understanding (which may be very flawed) is that there will be several of these, possibly unfolding episodically."<br/><br/>

In the commercial, two carefree Argentinian young adults are documenting their night on the town, when suddenly bright lights and clamorous, crashing sounds straight from the 1985 epic fill the streets.  The DeLorean skids out of control and into the storefront window of Garbarino.  Doc Brown emerges, with his signature blown-back white hair and dazed and confused look, amazed at the fact that it's 2011, and by the smart phone camera the young man in the commercial is holding, when suddenly the commercial ends.<br/><br/>

After watching the ad, there was a link to another angle of the arrival of Doc in 2011, this time from a security camera.  While I'm not sure if this is the first of many or the one and only of these ads, I know that the geeky 80s kid in me almost lost it when Christopher Lloyd emerged in his hazmat suit!  I can't wait to see more of the Doc!<br/><br/>
