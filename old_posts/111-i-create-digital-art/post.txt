Text: A while back, my awesome brother Landon (aka <a href="http://soundcloud.com/novamodus/" target="_blank">NovaModus</a>) came over and interviewed me about being a digital artist.  His goal was to feature several inspirational friends and their respective crafts.  I've always been blessed with a little brother who's always looked up to me and truly admired and respected what I did.  Today, Landon is himself an accomplished and extremely talented visual artist, specializing in web programming, flash animation and visual effects, as well as photography, videography.    He's actually the one who taught me the basics of After Effects!  Landon's main passion however is music.  He's currently working on numerous tracks, featuring several different styles and sounds, and is an extremely talented producer and vocalist.
