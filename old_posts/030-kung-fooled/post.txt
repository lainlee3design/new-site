Text: I love <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/freddiew" target="_blank">Freddy Wong</a>'s videos!  The effects he and his team pulls off are amazing and very inspirational!  And I really respect the fact that he is always open to seeking out other creatives to work and collab with.  For some reason, however, this latest video with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WongFuProductions" target="_blank">WongFuProductions</a> was one of his funniest to me!  Poking fun at stereotypes about Asian and Black folks, this video was very well done and very well executed!
