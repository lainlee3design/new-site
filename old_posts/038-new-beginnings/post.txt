Text: <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>LainLee3Design</strong></span> has relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area!  Now that I'm finished moving, I'm ready to get started on some new, fun, and exciting projects!  I'm especially excited with being so close to Silicon Valley and the possibility of working with clients from the software development and gaming industries.  I've loved the iPhone and iPad app design projects I've had so far this year, and now I'm really looking into doing more illustration for gaming companies, especially for games on iPhone/iPad.  As a gamer myself, I can really appreciate games with quality design and illustration, and would love to be a part of the magic.  I'm also actively looking for clients in need of logo work, branding, and identity, as well as website design.

If you or anyone you know is in need of fresh, quality graphic design, branding, or illustration, feel free to contact me with your project inquiries at <a href="mailto: lain3@lainlee3design.com">lain3@lainlee3design.com</a> or by phone at <strong>916.333.0399</strong>.  In the mean time, please feel free to take some time to view selected works in my portfolio by hovering over the "Portfolio" button above and choosing a page to view.
