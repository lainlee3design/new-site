Text: I have been a self-employed creative professional for about 7 years now.  In that time I have learned many lessons, suffered many failures, made many mistakes, and taken a lot of risks.  In doing so, I have learned many invaluable lessons that can never be taught from a textbook or blog post.  In that same amount of time though, I have learned many things about client relations and how clients view freelance creative professionals and the idea of a "freelancer" in general.  However, what I've also learned is how little respect clients have for the idea of a freelancer and the professionalism and skill set they represent.

What many clients don't understand about freelance professionals is that they are more than just designers, writers, illustrators, motionographers, photographers, and the countless other number of creative professionals out there earning their way of life off of their trade.  They are all jacks of all trades, masters of none (yes, even those who specialize in a certain skill or a multidisciplinary skillset).  They are accountants, project managers, collections agents, customer service representatives, sales agents, marketing and advertising executives and solopreneurs (n. pr. "so-low-on-trah-prah-new-errs" def. the solitary entrepreneur).  They have to be everything in addition to being creative professionals who are able to interface with clients from all walks of life and social, economic, religious and political backgrounds, and be able to translate a client's wants and needs into a solid, effective design, article, or visual piece.  It's a tough job being a freelancer, and what does not help in the slightest is the flack they receive for being lazy, too cheap or too expensive, and unreliable.

Now let's not ignore the obvious.  There are indeed freelancers out there that ruin things for the rest of the industry.  While we'll address those type of freelancers a little later on in this article, it should be understood that they are only a very small minority of the very large industry of creative professionals.  Within the last two years, the US experienced the worst recession period in the country's history since The Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  As a result, the freelance industry experienced a tremendous influx of contract workers who were either laid off from or forced to quit their jobs and were seeking to start a new career, or at least make money during their "off time".  Last year alone, online services such as Freelancer and Elance reported having over 300, 000 new professionals register with their websites and delivering on jobs worth over $343 million.<a href="http://www.myfoxorlando.com/dpp/news/local/020911-exploding-growth-of-freelance-work" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> According to a survey report issued by FreelanceSwitch.com earlier this year, as of 2010, 43.8% of the freelance workforce is self-taught, beating out the 41.9% that is university trained.  The growth of the industry is further supported by their survey which shows 20.7% of freelancers surveyed only having been freelancing for less than two years, while the bracket of those in the game for 5-9 years only reached about 11%.  This shows in part how much of the freelance industry has grown, but it also shows how inexperienced the new school is and how their poor business practices can ruin the idea of not only what a freelancer is capable of, but what being a freelancer truly means.
