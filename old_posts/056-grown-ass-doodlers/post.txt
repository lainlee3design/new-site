Text: Earlier his week, I posted about my first collabo project with the talented cats I met on Instagram, the homies @friks84, @edgarzilla and @epic1144!  Amidst their busy lives and hectic schedules, these gents showed true character, professionalism and integrity by hopping on board the project Sunday night, hustling and getting their contributions done this week!

That's right, within a week, we were able to put together our first dynamite collabo piece, and making it's debut here on The Blllog™, here it is: "Grown Ass Doodlers" by the IAC (Instagram Artist Collective).  The piece features amazing typography by Friks84 &amp; Epic One, and illustrations by the whole crew!  What made this project so much fun and so amazing is that it was a true collaborative effort, where 4 individual artists with 4 distinct styles came together and as Friks put it, "Just did art."  It was so much fun - there was no competition, just pure creation and it was wonderful!

Again, amazing job and HUGE kudos to all the fellas!  Be sure to check out <a href="http://friks84.com" target="_blank">Friks84</a> and <a href="http://epicuno.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Epic One</a> online (Edgar's still working on getting his site up ;D), and if you're on Instagram, follow us!

Stay tuned for the next Instagram Artist Collective project!!!
