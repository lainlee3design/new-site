Text: Anyone who knows me knows I'm a HUGE Seinfeld nerd!  I absolutely LOVE Seinfeld!  And I've always loved Jerry's SuperBowl commercials over the years, especially <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUmKgMdzwXU&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">the first one he did with Superman</a> back in 1998.  But this year's ad for the new Acura NSX is in the running to be a very close second.</br></br>
