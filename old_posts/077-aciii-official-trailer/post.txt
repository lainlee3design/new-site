Text: The official trailer for the next installment in the Assassin's Creed franchise dropped today and all I can say is "...."  That's right!  I couldn't say anything because my jaw had dropped to the floor!!!  Not only is the new story taking place a few hundred years after Revelations, but it's now touched down on American soil, set in the nation's infancy during the American Revolution.  Slated for release this October 31, 2012, Ubisoft is claiming this to be the "biggest, most ambitious" title in the franchise's history, a pretty tall order to fill after Brotherhood and Revelations IMO.

From <a href="http://techland.time.com/2012/03/05/ubisoft-unveils-new-trailer-for-assassins-creed-iii/" target="_blank">techland.time.com</a>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"In the game, Ratohnhaké:ton, who also goes by the more inconspicuous name of Connor, is a half-Native American, half-British killer looking to continue the franchise’s convoluted plot involving time travel and a longstanding feud between Assassins and Templars.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This time, you’ll get to practice your wall-climbing, backstabbing ways during the Revolutionary War, with the open style of gameplay letting you venture through Colonial towns and body-strewn battlefields, complete with historical figures such as George Washington.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Ubisoft is calling this the “biggest, most ambitious” title in the company’s history, which, hyperbole aside, should guarantee more hours of gameplay than the franchise’s other already expansive titles. Those who pre-order the game at Best Buy, GameStop or Amazon will get a collectible case with artwork from Alex Ross, the comic book artist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marvels-Kurt-Busiek/dp/078514286X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330972610&amp;sr=1-1">most famous for his series <em>Marvels</em></a>."</p>
