Text: This fall, Nickelodeon Studios is releasing a new, CGI-version of our beloved heroes in a half-shell, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  After seeing how amazing of a job Imagi Studios did with the franchise back in 2007, and given Nickelodeon's stellar performance with <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Legend_of_Korra#axzz1lcziaBB4" target="_blank">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a> and the all-new <a href="http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Legend_of_Korra#axzz1lcziaBB4" target="_blank">Avatar: The Legend of Korra</a>, I have to say that I'm pretty optimistic.  Especially after seeing how Playmate Toys has once again thrown their hat into the ring and taken on the challenge of updating the iconic toys from us 80's kids childhood.  Granted, they'll never be as awesome as <a href="http://www.bigbadtoystore.com/bbts/menu.aspx?menu=251" target="_blank">the originals</a>, but they're still pretty dope!

<strong>Action Figures</strong>

We love the new designs of the Turtles which also share aspects of their looks from the fantastic <a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/category/idw">IDW</a> comic. Each of the figures appear to be fairly articulated for their size and have the swivel/hinge joints mostly hidden thanks to their bulky knee and elbow pads. Speaking of size, each Turtle will also vary from 4.25" to 4.75" to better represent the different brothers. No completely shared bodies here, folks!

One thing you might have noticed: Raphael is missing a chunk out of the shell covering his chest. Looks like his mouth started "writing some checks", if you get our meaning...

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mich-9-16-11.jpg"><img title="mich-9-16-11" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mich-9-16-11.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="618" /></a>

Mikey has been given actual chain links for his nunchucku this time and it instantly makes his figure better.

<strong>Deluxe Power Sound FX Figures</strong>

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91161v2.jpg"><img title="91161v2" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91161v2.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="815" /></a>

These guys clock in a little taller than the regular figures and have springs in their arms and legs that activate phrases and sound effects. we're guessing the word "pizza" will be prevalent.

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91162v1.jpg"><img title="91162v1" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91162v1.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="595" /></a>

That is the BEST facial expression for a Michelangelo figure to date!

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91163v1.jpg"><img title="91163v1" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91163v1.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="657" /></a>

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91164v1.jpg"><img title="91164v1" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/91164v1.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="734" /></a>

<strong>Vehicles</strong>

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shellraiser-12-8-11.jpg"><img title="shellraiser-12-8-11" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/shellraiser-12-8-11.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="385" /></a>

This beauty is known as the Shellraiser. We can't wait to see how it stacks up to our vintage Party Wagon!

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94052-motobackhero_nomotion.jpg"><img title="94052-motobackhero_nomotion" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94052-motobackhero_nomotion.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="552" /></a>

This is the Rippin' Rider. It shares the Turtles love of the shell motif, which if you think about it, would be kind of like people being obsessed with covering their cars with human hair. Gross.

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94052insetclosedv5.jpg"><img title="94052insetclosedv5" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94052insetclosedv5.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="348" /></a>

The Ninja Stealth Bike will be seen in the new animated series and comes with it's own Raphael figure sporting a bright yellow helmet.

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94051_skateboard-ramp.jpg"><img title="94051_skateboard-ramp" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/94051_skateboard-ramp.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="470" /></a>

That freakishly-huge skateboard is the Sewer Spinnin' Skateboard. any of the Turtle figures will fit on it as it does 10 different tricks. How? A secret mix of magic and technology, of course!

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dragon-bike-122211.jpg"><img title="dragon-bike-122211" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dragon-bike-122211.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="491" /></a>

Not to be outdone, the evil Foot Clan have their own vehicle in the form of the Dragon Bike. It comes with an exclusive helmet-sporting Foot Soldier figure and he'll do a sweet 360 flip over the handlebars of the bike with the push of a button.

<strong>Playset</strong>

<a href="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/95010sewerlairplayset.jpg"><img title="95010sewerlairplayset" src="http://geek-news.mtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/95010sewerlairplayset.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="636" /></a>

It's great to see a return of playsets and this Secret Sewer Lair just happens to be a HUGE one! Look closely at the photo and you'll get a sneak-peek at Shredder, Kang, Splinter, the Foot Soldier, and April's upcoming figures.

You better believe that if we can get the bandanna from the Ninja Gear set around our adult heads, we'll be taking Leonardo's stealth Sword around the Geek offices for a little ninja-style payback!

Whew! That's enough ninja-related paraphernalia to keep even the biggest of Turtle fans satiated-- well, almost. Where's our Casey Jones?!
