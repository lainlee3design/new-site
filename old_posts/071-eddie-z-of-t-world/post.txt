Text: Yesterday I had the amazing opportunity of hanging out with the industrious and super-friendly Eddie Zammit of T-world.  Eddie and I started following each other a few weeks ago through Instagram.  Last week he emailed me and told me he'd be in town for a few days and to see if I'd like to meet up.  Of course I said yes, this was the guy behind the greatest t-shirt publication in the world, how could I say no?!?

Not knowing what to expect from our meetup, I jumped in the car yesterday around 4:15p and whisked down to the City to meet up with Eddie.  You know that awkwardness that sometimes sets in when you're meeting someone for the first time and aren't quite sure what to talk about after pleasantries are exchanged?  Well, that went right out the door with Eddie!  He was so approachable and pleasant, it felt like we'd known each other for years!  And of course, we had a favorite subject in common - t-shirts - so there was never anything to not talk about.

We first stopped by the coffee shop Sight Glass on 7th St.  Talk about a dope buildout - wooden beams, giant wooden doors, and iron &amp; metal embellishments made this place feel like a modern, urban silo.  It was great!  And the coffee was pretty good too!  Plus, they use Square for their POS system, so how could you not love it?!?

<p style="text-align: center;">Thanks for the coffee Eddie ;D</p>
We grabbed our coffee and headed upstairs to sit and talk tees, of course.  What a great opportunity this was for me, as Eddie proceeded to share with me "never-before-seen" pics from last year's T-world Australia Expo.  The expo housed thousands of fresh, graphic tees from designers all over the world, arranged in the same style Eddie said he arranges his own collection - by color and style!  Over 85,000 people were in attendance, and the curating was immaculate.  Eddie did a phenomenal job curating the expo like a museum exhibition, with super fresh portraits of designers, artists and photographers.  Eddie's working on plans to bring the next exhibit stateside, which would be more than amazing.  I also got to see some AMAZING plans in the works for the <a href="http://blog.anyforty.com/2012/03/06/anyforty-t-world-the-australian-invasion-series-update/" target="_blank">AnyForty™ x T-world Australian Invasion Series</a>!!!  All I can say is, y'all ain't ready!!! Haha!!!
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2478.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1729 aligncenter" title="IMG_2478" src="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/IMG_2478-614x822.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="740" /></a></p>
Then, Eddie pulled out the latest edition of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CE4QFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTworld.Journal&amp;ei=qwRyT_qlCuzJiQKP773RDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGrsDP-LN6-BhEfpKOMsu8OjLPrkg&amp;sig2=6k1QDmIe2a8KxF0G4HN2kA" target="_blank">T-world</a>.  Now, understand how painful this was for me.  I've never owned an issue of the semi-annual journal before, and let me just begin by saying - "EFFIN' WOW!!!"  The quality rivals that of most design books I've purchased.  But with over 13 years in magazine design and publication, art directing over 500 titles, would you expect anything less from the one-man compendium on t-shirts &amp; t-shirt culture?!?

The matted paper stock of the pages, the hardback cover, the layout and the content only made it MORE unbearable waiting another few weeks for my copy to come in the mail! (**Be expecting a new post covering the issue when it does)  But it was more than just the awesome sneak peeks, it was the knowledge that was shared with me so openly and honestly.  Eddie was very free with the info he shared which is rare among creative professionals sometimes, and it was nice to be able to talk openly with him about ideas, plans, and career choices.

After coffee, we met up with Eddie's travel mate Marta on our way to visit two other fresh street artists - <a href="http://www.deb.net.au/" target="_blank">Deb</a> and <a href="http://markbode.com" target="_blank">Mark Bode</a>.  On the way there, we walked down an alley where we found some fresh art by Seventh Letter and took some quick pics.

All-in-all, a great time with Eddie yesterday!  Thank you Eddie for your time and for establishing what I hope to be a long-standing relationship!  Safe travels my friend!
