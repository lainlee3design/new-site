Text: Through the Twittersphere, I was recently turned onto a dope brand out of Cleveland, OH by the name of <a href="http://ilthy.com" target="_blank">iLTHY</a> (or "I Love The Hype).  They just recently finished building out their workshop/storefront and I have to say that it is awesome - not quite the build out itself, but more so the art and energy that fill the space.  Their look is clean, their designs are fun, and overall, they need to be on your radar if you are a streetwear fiend or sneakerhead!  Check out this video from their time at the <a href="http://wmcfest.com/" target="_blank">Weapons of Mass Creation Festival</a> hosted by <a href="http://gomedia.us" target="_blank">GoMedia</a> last June.  My favorite part of their booth is not only the live screen printing, but the packaging and customization of each hand printed shirt!  What an awesome custom piece to walk away with!
