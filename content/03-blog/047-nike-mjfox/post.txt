Text: As many of you know by now, "Back to the Future" star Michael J. Fox, an American Icon, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1991.  Since then, he has started a foundation on a mission to cure the mysterious disease.  This year, Nike has joined the fight and teamed up with the Michael J. Fox foundation to raise money through a special 2011 "Back to the Future" promotion!

Devotees will remember in Back to the Future II Marty McFly wore a pair of futuristic 2015 Nike Hightops with automatic laces.  Well, Nike has gone ahead and released a special edition of these famed shoes (sans auto laces...sadface).  The new Nike Air McFlys (formerly known as the Nike Air Mags) are limited to 1,500 pairs and will be auctioned off on eBay between now and September 18th!  The proceeds will go to the actor's foundation to fund research for Parkinson's.  Mr. Fox appeared on The David Letterman show last night to promote the new collaboration/auction, after a day of press conferences and viral videos.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"It's kind of cool because it brings together three populations of  people with major joneses," Fox told Letterman. "The sneaker-heads who  love sneakers, the 'Back to the Future' guys who, believe me, are out of  their minds, in a good way, thank God for them. And people in the  Parkinson's community."

As a BTTF Nerd (did you miss <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/bttf-win">my last BTTF post</a>?) and recently-admitted sneakerphile myself, I am totally geeking out right now and would LOVE to get my hands on a pair of these!!!  My birthday just so happens to be coming up, a day after the auction ends actually...sooooo...you know...wink wink...size 10.5 thanks ;D

What about the rest of you sneaker/BTTF-heads out there?  What do you think of this momentous occasion?  Can you imagine what they'll be doing IN 2015?!?  Do you think that "Not until 2015" comment about "Power-Laces" is a nod at something they're actually working on?  Start the convo below!
