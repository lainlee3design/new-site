Text: So now that Facebook has made it standard that all pages have cover photos, it's about time you learned how to post cover photos with kick-ass clarity.  Now I know what you're thinking, "Why post about this? It's as easy as uploading a photo isn't it?"  The short answer, yes it is.  But the more in-depth answer, no, it's not.

Now I spend about 14 hours on the computer a day as a graphic designer, creating pixel-perfect graphics is my life.  And yet, when it comes to uploading photos to Facebook, I swear they have the uncanny ability to make you feel like a noob again.  In fact, the reason I'm writing this post is because I JUST DISCOVERED tip #2 TODAY!  This is because if you don't follow these two steps exactly, your photos won't be displayed correctly, thanks to the Facebook's image compression during upload.  It's a simple "turn of the wrist" between having pixelated, "blurry" graphics and having crystal clear, crisp graphics.  So without further adieu:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.)</strong> To get the fastest load times for your Facebook page, format your cover photo so that it's <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>851px wide by 315px tall</strong></span>, saved in RGB format, and keep your images under 100KB, if you can...as you can see mine was at least 785K, but FB will compress the photo upon upload so keep that in mind.  My suggestion, keep it at 72dpi and let the compressor worry about the file size.  Simply enough, right?  Okay, moving on...</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><a href="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FB_CoverPhotoPost_2.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2008" title="FB_CoverPhotoPost_2" src="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FB_CoverPhotoPost_2.png" alt="" width="553" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px; text-align: left;"><strong>2.)</strong> This is the most important part right here: <strong><em>SAVE YOUR IMAGE AS A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Png_file" target="_blank">.PNG</a> FILE</em></strong>.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=276329115767498" target="_blank">The Facebook help page</a> and countless other blogs will tell you to save the image as a <strong>JPEG</strong> and that as long as the image is saved in 851x315px format, it will display correctly.  This couldn't be more wrong!  <strong><em>The only way</em></strong> to display your cover photo with amazing clarity is to upload a higher quality image since Facebook compresses it upon upload.  You MUST save it as a PNG.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FB_CoverPhotoPost_1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-2009" title="FB_CoverPhotoPost_1" src="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/FB_CoverPhotoPost_1.png" alt="" width="553" height="367" /></a></p>
And voila!  That's it!  Easy enough right?  Like I said, I'm a creative professional, pushing pixels and creating images all day long and this perplexed me until today!  So don't feel bad if you've missed this tiny step too, I hope this simple 2-step tutorial helps you out and gets you crisp, clean cover photos like you wouldn't believe.
