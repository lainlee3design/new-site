Text: Well, this is it - 2012 is in full swing and it's that time of year again!  That's right, Valentine's Day is upon us again and in preparation, I have some "sweet" products that I've designed to help you express your love for that special someone!  Both products feature some of my favorite artwork and are the first in a line of fun products I'm looking to release this year!

For my yeti-loving, cupid-hating, t-shirt enthusiasts, I'm releasing the 2nd t-shirt from LainLee3Design for the year, titled "A Yeti Valentine" (the first, "<a href="http://shop.lainle3design.com/product/doodle-life" target="_blank">Doodle Life</a>", is currently in production and will be ready by <strong>Feb. 1</strong>).  If the demand is great enough, I will be getting a limited run of 36pcs. made in a mix of mens and womens sizes.

And for all of my Arrested Development fans out there, I have a George Michael + Maeby Fünke Valentine's Day card!  This card comes with a custom sweet "Candy Pink" envelope and a LainLee3Design custom greeting card seal.  If the demand is great enough, these cards will be limited to a 50pc. run.

If you're interested in either of these products, please email me at <a href="mailto:%20lain3@lainlee3design.com">lain3@lainlee3design.com</a> specifying which product you're interested in.  If you'd like the "A Yeti Valentine" t-shirt, please specify which size and style you'd like.
