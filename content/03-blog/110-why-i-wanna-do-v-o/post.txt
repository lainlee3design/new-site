Text: H. Jon Benjamin...where do I begin?  How about the years he lent his voice to the hilariously dysfunctional soccer coach, Jon McGuirk.  That's when I fell in love with how hilarious H. Jon was as a voice over actor.  Now, years later, he's lending his vocal prowess to Bob Belcher, star of Bob's Burgers on FOX.  Here's a hilarious video of Jon Benjamin doing his thing in the studio, messing with producer and good friend Loren Bouchard.  Thanks to my brother for sharing this with me!
