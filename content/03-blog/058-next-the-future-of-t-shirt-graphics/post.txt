Text: Great short documentary here, directed by <a href="http://www.versusmedia.com.au/" target="_blank">Versus</a> and presented by the good folks at <a href="http://facebook.com/Tworld.Journal" target="_blank">T-world</a>!  As a graphic designer and illlustrator OBSESSED with t-shirts, it's a great thing to see how something so simple is a cultural icon that is here to stay.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"Presented by T-world, NEXT was dedicated to the past, present and future of the T-shirt industry. From 4 November 4 to 11 December 2011, the intriguing industrial spaces of Sydney’s Cockatoo Island came alive with the Outpost Project – a world-class showcase of street art. Within the cavernous steel confines of the Heavy Machine Shop was NEXT, a vibrant display of the planet's most comprehensive collection of graphic T-shirts.</p>
Whether you’re an advocate for design, graffiti, skate, street or urban, the T-shirt is the singular identifying uniform speaking the voice of youth culture.

Stay tuned for another NEXT event coming soon."
