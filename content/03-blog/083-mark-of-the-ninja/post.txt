Text: *UPDATED 9.13.12: So I purchased <a href="http://www.markoftheninja.com/" target="_blank">MOTN</a> the other night but didn't really get to play it until last night and all I have to say is, "O-M-G"!  Mark of the Ninja is another hit from <a href="http://kleientertainment.com/" target="_blank">Klei</a> and in this "blogger's" opinion, is an instant new classic.  MOTN combines stealth elements from games such as Metal Gear Solid, Tenchu, and Splinter Cell with elements of critical problem solving, giving it more of an edge than just a game that requires you to sneak behind an enemy and slit his throat.  With amazing artwork from artist Jeff Agala, and plenty of unlockable extra content and challenges, Klei has released another amazing hit!
