Text: Cartoon Network turns 20 this year, which doesn't at all make me feel like I'm getting old (meh*).  To celebrate, <a href="http://ilovedust.com" target="_blank">ilovedust</a> put together this awesome music video that, to me, truly captured the fun and carefree nature of what Cartoon Network was always about for me as a kid - great cartoons with memorable characters.  So glad to see the classics make an appearance, like Fred &amp; Barney, but also to see the more recent "classics" from my youth like Dexter &amp; DeeDee, Johnny B, Ed, Edd, &amp; Eddy, Cow &amp; Chicken, Courage, Samurai Jack (my fave), Bloo and most recently, Jake and Finn and the guys from The Regular Show.  Thanks for all of the inspiration over the years CN, Happy 20th! ;D
