Text: It's a big world out there, and while the world is full of billions of  people separated by race, color, and creed, we're all connected through  the human experience. As co-bearers of the burden of humanity, we share a  collective responsibility to help out those less fortunate than  ourselves.

I truly believe in helping out others who have a need,  especially a need for the basic amenities we take for granted every  day, such as clean drinking water. As Americans, we are blessed with an  over-abundance of clean, filtered, cold, bottled water, with a luxury to  choose from a variety of brands. However, there are those who struggle  daily to find water to drink and bathe with. Two years ago, I witnessed  first hand this need in Delhi, India, where I watched as long lines of  impoverished Indians from the make-shift shanty towns formed around a  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgITzKgxzTU" target="_blank">water truck</a> , waiting to fill their 1 gal. buckets. These water trucks  are issued by the government in response to the inadequate distribution  of clean water. The buckets are supposed to supply an entire family with  water to drink and bathe with for a week, a family who'd normally have  to pump contaminated water from filthy wells. Delhi, India is the 6th  largest metropolis in the world, with a population of 17.3 million  people, 1/3 of whom live in shanty towns and are therefore not  recognized by the government. But it is still only one of the many areas  in the world that are in dyer need of clean drinking water.

There  are 1 billion people in need of clean drinking water around the world,  the majority of which reside in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South  America. According to the <span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span> website, the UN predicts that  one tenth of the global disease burden can be prevented simply by  improving water supply and sanitation.

In response to this global crisis, I have designed a custom t-shirt for sale through my new clothing brand, <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">ThreeQltyWares</span></strong>, in order to raise money to send to the leading clean water charity, <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/onetwofiftyshirt" target="_blank"><span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span></a>.  Through <span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span>, we are trying to raise enough money to have 3 new clean drinking water wells built in impoverished areas.  Please help <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>ThreeQltyWares</strong></span> raise money to send to <span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span> to help fund the planting of  wells to supply clean drinking water to those who need it!  One well can serve a community of approximately 250 people.

By purchasing  this shirt, you are donating $25 directly to <span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span> and  supplying one person with clean drinking water.  If we can meet our goal of $20,000, we will have raised enough money to  sponsor a water project and latrines at a school and serve up to 1,000  students, teachers and surrounding community members!

If you don't wish to purchase a shirt, you can still  donate directly by clicking <a href="http://mycharitywater.org/p/donate?campaign_id=17205" target="_blank">here</a> . Remember, $20 gives 1 person clean  drinking water, but $20,000 gives it to over 1,000 teachers, students and community members!  Please help us reach our initial goal, donate now!

100% of  the profits go to <span style="color: #2296df;">charity: water</span> and helping provide those in need with  clean drinking water. Please help us make a difference. Thank you.
