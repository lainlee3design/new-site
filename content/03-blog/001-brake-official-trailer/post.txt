Text: In <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1990181/" target="_blank">Brake (2012)</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001151/" target="_blank">Stephen Dorff</a> plays a United States Secret Service agent who wakes up locked inside the trunk of a terrorist's car.  He's encased in a torture chamber rigged with a tube threw which his transgressors can administer any number of torture devices, a clock that counts down to his next torture, and a phone where he can hear his wife being tortured on the other line.  Oh and did I mention that the car itself was a car-bomb?  His only way out is to give into the terrorists' demands and give them the information they want.  But will he?

Directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868650/" target="_blank">Gabe Torres</a>.
