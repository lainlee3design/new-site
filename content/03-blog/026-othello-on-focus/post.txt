Text: For those of you who know me pretty well, you're more than likely aware of two things: I'm great friends with probably the illest emcee of our generation, and his song "Focus" is my daily anthem for perseverance!  I asked Othello to break down his creative process on the song and to enlighten us on what inspired him to write it.  Listen to the track as you read his story below.

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The year was 2009, the place was the studio I had set up on the bottom  level of our condo in Beaverton, Oregon.  My Family and I were about 4  months into our relocation from Michigan back to the Pacific Northwest.   In the summer months just prior to our move, I was on the Vans Warped Tour.  We hit every major city from coast to coast and the idea was to build  momentum musically as well as financially while I was out.  This tour was  a sacrifice for my fam and I.  After a failed attempt at keeping up with  the tour by Van in hopes to have my wife and son on the road with me  (along with <a href="http://humblebeast.com/artists/braille/" target="_blank">Braille</a> and his fam), I had to reclaim my spot on the tour  bus and send everyone home, because gas prices were killing any hope we had  to save enough dough to move that coming October.  [In the end] the sacrifice paid  off and we made it happen.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"While the Midwest was already neck deep in economic despair, it was  unbeknown to us that folks had all fled to Portland and Seattle from  Michigan (specifically) to find employment.  This, paired with a crippling  spell that seemed to be over the independent music industry, left me  borderline 'income-less'.  It was like overnight.  I was literally putting food on the table (barely) off of collab work alone.  Thus bringing us to the song 'Focus'.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"<a href="http://www.goontrax.jp/" target="_blank">Goon  Trax</a> is a Japan-based record label that I had done some work for prior  to our move.  I remember this specific opportunity coming through in the  clutch.  Times were rough.  This song ['Focus'] was written <em>to myself</em> for the most  part, <em>reassuring my faith in God's ability to work out tragedy for  growth, progression, spiritual and mental therapy</em>, and of course a  paycheck.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"The creative process was different too. The song was for one of  Goon Trax artists <strong>Robert DeBoron</strong>. He sent me a very basic skeleton of  the track with what seemed to be all keyboard sounds. If you are  familiar with <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lightheaded" target="_blank">Lightheaded</a> or my work, you can see how I might not have  been exactly <em>thrilled</em> about how this was going to turn out.  Nonetheless, the emotion of the track [in turn] pulled out some raw emotion and forced me  to dig deep into some perspective on my world at the time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">"When Goon Trax sent me the final version of the track, I was  shocked at its outcome.  The beat was full with live strings, guitar,  piano and everything.  I feel like it ended up as a great collaborative  effort, one that found me at a vulnerable time of life.  I've gotten word  back from cats that have shared in the experience with the song as  well.  <em>Music fused with honesty, vulnerability, perspective, and truth  can definitely birth therapy</em>."</p>
Big shout to Othello for providing us with this terrific insight to a song that has touched so many in a profound and inspirational way; a song that I hope you dig just as much as I do.  If you'd like to hear more of Othello's music, check him out on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/alive-at-the-assembly-line/id268647531" target="_blank">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Othello" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/othelloone" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> or on his <a href="http://myspace.com/othello" target="_blank">Myspace</a> page.  You can also follow him on <a href="http://twitter.com/othelloone" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/othellorockswell" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.  In the mean time, stay inspired, stay active, keep advancing, and stay focused ;D
