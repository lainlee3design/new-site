Text: As you may or may not know I've started a fundraising campaign for clean water called "<a href="http://onetwofifty.bigcartel.com/product/onetwofifty-tee">OneTwoFifty</a>".  The main purpose of the campaign is to raise money and awareness for and about the need for clean water in developing nations, and the plight that over 1 billion people suffer due to lack of access to clean water to drink and bathe with.  In the past month, I've been educating myself on the crisis and learning how many other individuals and organizations are out there fighting for the same cause.  What's been really inspiring to me, however, is learning that one of my all-time favorite actors is the co-founder of one of the world's leading clean water organizations.

Matt Damon co-founded <a href="http://water.org">water.org</a> with his partner Gary White.  Together, they're not only trying to help developing communities gain access to clean water, but also engage the communities and help them learn how to take things to the next level for sustainable solutions for clean water.

I thought this video of Matt Damon was awesome, hearing him talk about the water crisis and his organization.  Take a few minutes to just watch, and hopefully you'll be able to learn a little more about how over a billion people have little to absolutely no access to one of life's most basic necessities.
