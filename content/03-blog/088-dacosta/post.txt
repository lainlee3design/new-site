I've followed Dacosta's work for a few years now, discovering him when I was researching manufacturing my own line of vinyl toys.  More recently, he and I have been following each others work on Instagram, which has been a more personal and rewarding experience.  With Instagram, I feel like have connected more and more with artists on a personal level, where you get to see their work and they get to see yours.  It's only about the work, and not about the social media hype.  I love it.
