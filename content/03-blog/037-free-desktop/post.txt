Text: In honor of the premiere of <a href="http://super8-movie.com" target="_blank">Super 8</a> today, I'm offering this print as a FREE desktop wallpaper for your download and viewing pleasure!  J.J. Abrams is one of my biggest inspirations in the creative field, and his energetic <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Ftalks%2Fj_j_abrams_mystery_box.html&amp;rct=j&amp;q=jj%20abrams%20TED%202007&amp;ei=XVvyTb63CpT0swOQ48jNCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFZ327SKH5Y8MuIFMWzwn4NI8YJMw&amp;sig2=mG6Ch11DLhXOYtsBD8lCvA&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">TED Talk</a> from 2007 remains in heavy rotation on the AppleTV.  This print is inspired by one of his quotes from that TED Talk, in which J.J. said that "Mystery is the catalyst for imagination".  As an homage to J.J., I have also included several glyphs at the bottom of the print, serving as clues to the different projects J.J. has worked on and entertained us with over the years.  See if you can figure out what each one represents!

The wallpaper is available for download on my <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/?type=freebies">Freebies</a> page in 3 different screen sizes: 1920 x 1280  |  1440 x 900  |  1024 x 768

I had a lot of fun making this and hope you enjoy it as well!  Cheers and see you at the movies!
