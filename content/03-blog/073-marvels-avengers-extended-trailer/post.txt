Text: Really, does ANYTHING really need to be said to accompany this trailer?!?  Mr. Whedon...thank you for bringing Earth's Mightiest Heroes to life in full, visual, EPIC glory!!!  By the looks of this, you'll do comic nerds of the world SO proud!!!  I CAN tell you this - best line of the movie: (Loki) "I have an army..." (Tony Stark) "WE have a HULK!" LOLOL
