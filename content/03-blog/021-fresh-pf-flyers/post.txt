Text: Today was one of those random moments when I found myself thinking about my next pair of kicks.  Now I'm in no way a sneakerhead, but I do love a fresh pair of sneaks, especially those that not many people are rockin'.  For many years, while everyone was repping Air Force Ones and Jordans, I decided to go with my brand of choice, Puma.  But Puma got old after a while, and I switched to Supra hi-tops after that.  Now, I've been thinking about grabbing a pair of PF Flyers.  Most kids who grew up during the early 90s most likely remembers that iconic scene from the cult classic, The Sandlot, where Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez laces up his fresh PF Flyers to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL__v94Dae4&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">ace the Beast</a>.  I don't know why this scene and brand popped in my head, but after checkin' out PF Flyers site, I'm pretty much sold that my next pair of kicks will be the Bob Cousy Hi's!  As long as I don't lace up just to outrun a 200lb. bulldog across town, I think I'll be ok!
