Text: Happy New Year everyone! First, a quick word from <a href="http://www.jamiehewlett.com/" target="_blank">Jamie Hewlett</a>, illustrator for The Gorillaz and filmmaker.

It's been a busy 2013 for LainLee3Design so far, which is exactly how I like it!  As a freelancer, you learn to recognize the "trends" or patterns in client behavior, and unfortunately, those trends can sometimes affect your outlook on the year in negative ways.  Thankfully though, as I continue to work hard to make LainLee3Design bigger and better, constantly honing my craft and sharing my experience with the world, the trends are beginning to change and take new shape.

With that said however, there's a very fine line that separates fun and work when you're a solopreneur.  When you're doing what you love for a living, it's very easy to blur that line and lose sight of continuing to do what you love.  It's way too easy to focus continually on work, the "next big thing", always moving forward.  This becomes a major problem (and sometimes even, a hindrance), when (1) you don't take time to reflect on your accomplishments and (2) take time every day to remind yourself that you're doing what you're doing because YOU want to, because it makes YOU happy.

This conundrum may not be entirely your fault though.  With a freelancer having to wear SO many hats, it's very easy to lose sight of what you love and replace it with what you have to do.  I would propose a simple remedy to this problem: set clear goals for your career and constantly remind yourself of "why" you're doing what you do.  If your goal is strictly to make more money, you're doomed to fail from the beginning.  Doing what you love cannot be about making money.  Now you CAN make money as a result of doing what you love, but understand there is a difference between using what you love to make money and making money doing what you love.

I was reminded of this the hard way last year.  2012 was a great year for learning for me and offered many experiences for me to learn from.  With the launch of IIIShirts™, I learned plenty about order fulfillment, customer service and running an online store efficiently.  However, with the added responsibility of IIIShirts™ on top of my freelance workload, I quickly burned myself out from work overload.  Making money doing what I love became about doing what I love to make money, and it was exhausting.  This led to me getting discouraged easily, which in turn led me to get real down on myself.  For the first time in my career, being completely exhausted from the grind, I threw my hands up and said, "I'm done".  Through my first Kickstarter campaign back in April 2012, I learned about timing when launching a project, planning ahead and social media influence when trying to get a project crowdfunded (which helped with <a href="http://kck.st/YYWZRS" target="_blank">my more recent Kickstarter</a>, which was just successfully funded yesterday).  And with the release of my first-ever "year-end-review" <a href="http://goodsie.com/store/lainlee3design/collected-works2012" target="_blank">book</a> in December 2012, I learned the most valuable lesson of the importance of taking the time to look back on my accomplishments and reflect on the wins, since the losses are what are at the forefront of your mind normally.

All of these examples serve the same purpose.  For one, they served to teach me to never give up.  Failing isn't "failing", but instead is a stepping stone, a learning tool.  As with science and testing out a hypothesis through experimentation, "failure" simply asks you to question why something didn't work and then learn from that mistake or miscalculation.  For example, <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/fail-to-succeed#.UOyXeLbgyHk" target="_blank">James Dyson</a>, inventor of the Dyson Vacuum Cleaner, built 5,127 prototypes over the span of 15 years before he perfected the DC01!  Secondly, it reminds us to take the time to reflect on those goals we set for ourselves and remember that we're doing what we love<em> simply because we love doing it</em>.  <a href="http://brandonrike.com" target="_blank">Brandon Rike</a>, graphic designer and illustrator, puts it best with one of his mottos, <em><strong>"Fight to stay excited."</strong></em>  His manifesto, hanging on my wall adjacent to my desk, elaborates that motto further:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><span style="color: #888888;">"Doing what you love is a fight.  An ongoing battle against every influence that wants you to conform.  There is no solace in the conformity, only a blurred view of what you set out to be.  Spend your life creating something.  Betray the institution."</span></strong></span></p>
I've spent my life creating, but there have always been forces battling against me to try to get me to conform.  The pressures of everyday life, wanting a better future for myself and my fiancee, trying to grow my business, and thinking I might have to get a 9-5 job to make those things happen - all of these forces were weighing me down at one point.  Even as Jamie Hewlett said in the video above, even your daily chores and household "to-do's" can start getting in your way when you let them, and you soon find that it's not that you don't have time to get work done, it's that you're not making the time.  Because as soon as you allow that line to be crossed, when work you once loved to do becomes work you have to do, you start allowing things to get in the way of you getting your work done.

But that's the key, isn't it?  The key is to always approach your work with the mindset that you're doing what you love, not doing it to pay the bills.  In my case, I was reminded of why I do what I do...because it's my passion.  So this year, I'll be focusing more on doing what I love solely because I love doing it, and letting the rest fall into place!
