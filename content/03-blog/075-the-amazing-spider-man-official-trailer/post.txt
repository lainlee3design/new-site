I have to say, after Sam Raimi's awful job on Spider-Man 3 (if I ever see another <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRPoiTHMuzc&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">superhero bust out in a musical number</a>, I swear I will storm out of the theater in a fit of rage), I really wasn't sure what to make of <a href="http://www.theamazingspiderman.com/" target="_blank">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>.  For one thing, I've never actually seen anything <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1940449/" target="_blank">Andrew Garfield</a> has been in, and for another, I wasn't really a fan of the new costume.  And I wasn't quite sure where they were going with taking Peter Parker's story all the way back to his teenage years.  But after seeing the new trailer, I have to say I'm pretty optimistic.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1297015/" target="_blank">Emma Stone</a> looks like she's going to do fantastic as Gwen Stacy, and frankly, she looks better as a blonde for a ginger than Kirsten Dunst looked as a ginger for a blonde (haha).  But the direction and action look amazing, and I can only hope the story and character development hold up against the visuals in the film.  Oh, and did I mention Lizard is the latest villain?!?  Yeah!
