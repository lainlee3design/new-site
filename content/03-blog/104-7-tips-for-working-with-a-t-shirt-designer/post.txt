Text: I read this great post a while back earlier this year and recently ran across it again.  I think it's a great post not just for working with a t-shirt designer, but as a general guideline for working with any designer, be it graphic, web or illustrator.  This post is for the clients of the world looking to work with design professionals.  I've kept some of the original post, but have changed some of the content and personalized it more.  You can read one of the original posts <a href="http://pedrotuma.com/industry-knowledge/7-tips-for-working-with-a-t-shirt-designer/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">1.) Don't Buy Pre-Made Designs</span></strong>

There is nothing more unoriginal about a t-shirt brand that buys pre-made designs from designers and simply having them change a few elements like adding in their brand mark and/or name!  Some people treat sites like <a href="http://www.mintees.com/" target="_blank">Mintees </a>as a shopping destination for t-shirt designs.  <em>If you’re creating a clothing line, don’t just choose random, well-designed pieces of artwork.</em>  Take the time to conceptualize designs that fit within the context of your brand, it only makes sense.  Now this isn't to say that some of us designers have artwork we've toiled over for a brand who's bailed out on a project, and sometimes we'll offer those designs up for sale.  And there are those bottom feeders who'll jump at the chance to grab a design, slap their brand on it, and call it the new new.  But if you're working on creating a new brand, make it your own.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">2.) Don’t Ask a Designer to Design Outside Their Style</span></h2>
This is something I get asked to do quite a lot.  As a versatile designer myself, I'm able to design in a variety of styles.  It's often that I get asked by clients, "Here's what I want, can you give me something that looks like this?"  At that time, it's when I let them know the same thing I'm sharing with you.  The variety of styles among designers is the spice of life and is what gives our industry its beauty and creativity, different styles encourage a vast range of designs.  So if you want a particular style from a particular designer, be sure to go straight to the source.  Don't opt for a "cheaper" designer because the designer you wanted was too expensive, then ask that designer to create something in the others style.  If you want to create a respectable brand, you get what you pay for, so hire a professional graphic designer.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">3.) Let Them Know When You Decide to Go in Another Direction</span></h2>
Sometimes, you may show an interest in a certain artist’s work, and change your mind soon after. Let them know that you’ve changed your mind, because communication is important.  It’s unfair to leave an artist hanging if they thought you were interested in their work.  If their prices are too steep, but you still really want to work with them, say “sorry, but my budget is X, would you be able willing negotiate a price”.  You might get lucky, if you’re nice and professional about it.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">4.) Always Offer to Pay a Deposit, Don't Be Cheap</span></h2>
A lot of times, newer brands are intimidated by professional graphic designer prices.  They normally charge a premium, so don’t offend them by trying to low-ball them and say, “Well, designer X can do the same thing for 50% of what you’re asking for.”  You’re coming off as an unprofessional douche.  Even if your designer doesn't make it a requirement, offer to pay them a deposit of at least 1/2 the total upfront.  It’s an agreement that protects both of you, so (1) they are compensated for the initial time spent on the design, and (2) you have collateral in case you end up working with a less-than-honest designer (beware, they are out there).  I usually design things in two phases.  I send an invoice for 50% of the total payment upfront, then send them a sketch of the composition.  After the sketch is approved, I’ll finalize the design, send the invoice for the balance, and deliver the final design once payment for the remaining amount has been received. Of course, if they don’t actually like the design after the sketch, they can ask for changes, or stop everything right there.  That way, I have at least been compensated designer for the time spent doing the sketch.  Remember that a self-employed designer's time is their most valuable commodity.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">5.) Always Have a Contract</span></h2>
It’s very important to have a signed contract with a designer, because it shows your trust, and your agreement to pay the designer.  If they don’t deliver, or if you don’t pay them, either party can refer to the contract and make a case.  If things get elevated, though it normally isn’t necessary unless it’s for a major amount of money, you can take it to small claims court.  Of course, if you’re talking about a $300 t-shirt design, it shouldn’t really escalate to that level.  The contract should explicitly state a number of things, including the date of initial correspondence, start and end times of the project, any previously discussed milestones, what to do in the event either party isn't happy with the process, and who owns the rights to the design.  If the design rights are only for t-shirt printing, the designer should expect to get paid more if the brand uses it on totes and posters.  If the designer grants all rights for the design, the brand can use it for whatever they want.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">6.) Make Your Briefs Clear and Concise</span></h2>
When I get client work, I personally hate getting really vague briefs.  For example, some people will emails, “Yo, my name is X, I'm a huge fan of ur work, can you design a t-shirt for us?  You can do whatever you want, I trust you!  What's ur rates?”  That’s a poor brief, because you have given no creative direction or indication of what kind of style or mood you’re looking for.  Creative people don't just magically create awesome designs out of thin air.  Unless we're creating for ourselves, where the creative direction is still clearly defined, we're unable to reach into a client's mind and pull out a masterpiece.  More often than not, clients will know exactly what they don't want to see, but have a very vague idea of what they do want to see.  When you contact a designer for a design, be sure to include the following in your email:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Your name and contact information
• Your brand and a brief description of what your brand is about
• The design you'd like with a description of what you'd like to see (provide any reference images you might have)
• How you intend to use the design, how soon you'll need it, and what your budget is</p>
The main thing to remember, don't fake the funk: if you're a small brand with no budget, just say so.  And be original.  Sometimes new brands will get cut a price break just because they're vision is clear and original.  But remember two things: (1) You get what you pay for, so if you want fresh, professional design, be ready to pay for it; and (2) you're seeking professional help, so don't insult them by trying to low-ball them...and PLEASE DON'T TRY TO USE DESIGNER JARGON!  WE don't even use it, and it's just annoying when you're trying to say something by using terms you THINK we'll understand.  Just be as clear as you can, part of our job is to decipher the rest.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">7.) When It's All Over, Give Your Designer a Shirt</span></h2>
This is one of my personal pet-peeves.  Often times, one of the caveats a client will throw in at the end of an email or phone call is "...And let me know your size, I'll send you a shirt once they're printed!"  Yeah...this has YET to happen!  This is bad form.  If you end up using the design on a t-shirt, be sure to send the designer one. It’s not something you need to do, but it’s just a nice gesture.  It's not even about getting to wear the shirt all the time, it's more about getting to see the hard work you've done manifest, getting to see it in person, feel it and examine it.  Designers are just as proud of the work they do as you are to have it represent your brand, so send them a shirt!  It's the right thing to do ;D
