Text: One of my resolutions this year was to push myself not only creatively, but professionally.  I wanted to be apart of a larger design community and actually connect with the artists I follow, instead of always admiring them through the screens of my computer and phone.  Since I'm an avid  Instagram user, and that is where I've had the most meaningful exchange of ideas and feedback from my design peers, I decided to reach out to a number of artists to see if they would like to join me on my "Collabo-A-Month" project.  The plan is to collaborate with a different artist each month this year and see what sort of fun and interesting collaboration pieces come out of our teaming up.

This month's collaboration was with a great designer and guy by the name of Jeff Stone.  Jeff operates under the moniker <a href="http://www.behance.net/enotsdesign/frame" target="_blank">ENOTS Design</a> out of Colorado.  I actually met Jeff through Dribbble where we quickly developed an appreciation for each others work. His vintage-inspired logo and typography work is what caught my attention, and I immediately knew what project I wanted to work on with Jeff.

A few months ago I was inspired by a commercial to sketch an "Ol' Tyme Brawler", such as one you'd see in a Guy Ritchie movie!  It was a fun sketch, but I wasn't sure where I wanted to go with it.  I showed Jeff the sketch and he came up with an amazing idea: instead of "Old Tyme Brawler", we'd call him "Old Tyme Drawler" and make him more reflective of the "Doodle Life".  I amended the illustration, while Jeff came up with the vintage type and frame.  To top it all off, we gave the "Drawler" some ink of some of our other work.  You can see some screenshots of the piece below.
