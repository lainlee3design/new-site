Text: Ever since switching over to Xbox from PS2, I've never really been a fan of Sony products!  Never even had the urge to grab a PS3, despite all of the bells &amp; whistles.  The whole thing with them showcasing fake in-game footage at E3 6 yrs ago didn't really help their case either.  It's not their fault I guess, Xbox just has them beat in overall quality of gameplay and better titles to offer.  Oh! And then the whole Blu-Ray take over leading to the death of HD was just the icing on the cake.  [Side rant: This was spit in the face of Microsoft/Xbox owners because Xbox had an HD Disc player and PS3 had the Blu-Ray Disc player.  So Sony just couldn't handle the competition!]  I'd have to agree with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AyVh1_vWYQ" target="_blank">The Onion</a> in that it seems like all that Sony releases these days is over-priced equipment that talks a great game but doesn't ever deliver.  Okay...rant over, because this  whole set up ends with a HUGE BUT...

BUT!!!  The only thing that has ever made me reconsider my stance on Sony and the PS3 has been Naughty Dog's <strong>"Uncharted"</strong> Franchise.  I won't lie, I played the first level of "Uncharted 2" at my friend's office last year and was completely BLOWN AWAY!!!  Mindgrapes, completely squashed!  And with <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>"Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"</strong></span> about to hit stores later this year, the urge to grab a PS3 JUST FOR THIS FRANCHISE is getting harder to resist!

So while I'm still hatin' on Sony, I might be eatin' a little crow later this year if I can't fight the urge to succumb to the "Uncharted" allure.  I've posted some videos below to share in the awesomeness.  Peace.
