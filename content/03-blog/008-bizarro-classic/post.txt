Text: Robb Pratt follows up his amazing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2WVlmNqMMs&amp;feature=plcp" target="_blank">classicly-animated Superman short</a> with another painfully brief short film, <a href="http://youtu.be/lSIlr2-mw-w" target="_blank">Bizarro Classic</a>, featuring the Man of Steel's defunct clone Bizarro.  Mr. Pratt, your style is AMAZING!!! PLEASE support this video by liking and sharing it!  If we're lucky enough, someone will give him a budget and team to animate an entire film for us!  Interesting tid-bit, Superman and Bizarro are both voiced by John Newton, star of the classic Superboy television series.
