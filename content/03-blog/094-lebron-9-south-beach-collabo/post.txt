Text: I've teamed up with my homie Siege of <a href="http://siegeink.com" target="_blank">siegeINK</a> in Miami to bring you guys a special "collabo" edition of my "99 Problems" tee!  This special, limited edition tee is perfect for the sneakerhead in your life and is customized to match their new <a href="http://www.nicekicks.com/2012/03/nike-lebron-9-ps-elite-south-beach-release-date/" target="_blank">Lebron 9 P.S. Elite "South Beach" kicks</a>, which drop June 2 here in the US.  The shirt is limited to 50 individually numbered pieces, and once they're gone, they're gone for good!  Oh, and as an added bonus, each "99 Problems" shirt sold this summer comes with a download of "Can I Kick It?", a digital track by the homie <a href="http://www.myspace.com/brandontimothy" target="_blank">Brandon Timothy</a>.  It's a perfect combination for "kickin'" off your summer right!

You can order yours today in the old IIIStore™ <a href="http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com" target="_blank">HERE</a>.  Starting tomorrow, these will only be available in the NEW IIIStore™, <a href="http://shop.lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">HERE</a>.  Big shouts to Siege for hooking up the back neck design and Brandon Timothy for the fresh beats!
