For those of you who didn't know, the <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>"Gaman" Japan Relief T-Shirt </strong></span>was a fundraising project my fiancée and I put together to raise money for the relief efforts in Japan.  After the devastating natural disasters Japan suffered back in March, we felt compelled to help out in some way.  We designed the Gaman T-Shirt based off of the word "Gaman", the Japanese word for "perseverance, patience, and tolerance."  "Gaman" is more than a word, it's a way of life and an ideology and in light of the recent events, has become a rallying cry for the victims.  It was a very successful two week project that resulted in us sending nearly $1200 to <a href="http://redcross.org" target="_blank">The Red Cross</a> and <a href="http://salvationarmyusa.org" target="_blank">The Salvation Army</a>, the two organizations we found to be doing the most on-the-ground work in Japan to aid in providing relief.

The "Gaman" Project may be over, but there is still much MUCH more to be done to help the Japanese back on their feet.  Nuclear radiation poisoning has damaged the air quality as well as their livestock and agriculture.  Whole areas have been devastated and laid to waste, the ruins demolished and flattened  in an effort to clear the wreckage.  Food, water, shelter and health care are in desperate need of help and assistance.  Don't forget about them.
