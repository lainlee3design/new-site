Text: It's pretty safe to say that I'm a Machead.  Hasn't always been that way, up until 2008 I was working off of an all Windows-based system.  But once I crossed over, there was no looking back.  And until now, Microsoft has not given me a single reason to give their products a second glance.

While watching <a href="http://hulu.com">Hulu Plus</a> on<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank"> Xbox</a>, I must've seen the commercial for the new <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Surface/posts/486186938087943" target="_blank">Microsoft Surface</a> a couple dozen times.  At first, I didn't really pay too much attention to it.  But then, I watched it yesterday and absolutely fell in love with it.  The choreography, the camera direction, the music - there are so many reasons why this commercial is amazing!  First, it was directed by <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0160840%2F&amp;ei=Trm-UKOTLabfigLm0oCADg&amp;usg=AFQjCNELonKatgoSSQriQiJht-rPgMTWxQ&amp;sig2=xkyszhQIg1rMXE4y9HSpjg" target="_blank">Jon M. Chu</a>, director of G.I.Joe: Retaliation, <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/the_lxd_in_the_internet_age_dance_evolves.html" target="_blank">The LXD</a>, and Step Up 3D.  I've always greatly admired Jon Chu's cinematic eye, he's got an uncanny way of moving the camera as if it's a member of the cast, a part of the choreography.  Speaking of choreography, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcawcaKzT_g" target="_blank">Christopher Scott and Jamal Sims</a> were behind the amazing choreography in the commercial.  Lastly, it features world-class, bad-ass dancers such as Daniel "Cloud" Campos and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNJM8qd4x5Q" target="_blank">"Madd" Chadd Smith</a> (aka THE human robot).

In conjunction with the commercial, I've noticed Microsoft has rolled out a brand new identity since the launch of Windows 8.  Even Xbox Live has received a new Microsoft facelift.  As a branding specialist, it's a refreshing thing to see.  Though I'm a Machead, I can appreciate great design and branding, no matter who's rolling it out!

Check out the commercial as well as the behind-the-scenes videos below!  Try to keep your jaw off the ground and enjoy the "Movement"! ;D
