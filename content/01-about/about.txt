Hailing from Alleghany County, PA Lain 3 (aka Steel Town Native) has been living the doodle life since he could first hold a pencil.  Always one to think big and shoot for the stars, Lain 3 has always been attracted to solid branding and creative forms of entertainment.  In elementary school, he concieved several concepts for comic books and cartoons with fellow childhood doodlers.  Throughout his middle school years, he worked with the school newspaper, where he met other artists and developed an interest in clay animation and live action film.  Throughout high school, he cultivated that passion for live action film and during college he co-wrote and directed two award-winning [short films](#), and wrote a feature-length film script with good friend, Cedrick Bradley.

Lain’s career in graphic design started in 2003, when he began developing t-shirt designs for various local clothing lines.  When his screenprinter gifted him a copy of Illustrator to help augment the printing process, a whole new world was opened up to him and his professional design career was born.  After years of hard work, passion and dedication, Lain 3 has diversified his artistic arsenal to include graphic & web design, illustration, and motion graphic work.  His versatility allows him to specialize in a broad range of artistic styles, all the while putting his own unique twist on them, creating truly original pieces for his clients.

Driven by a true passion for the creative life, solid branding, creative characters and clean design, Lain’s goal has always been the same: to design with passion and deliver with purpose.  Lain's ability to utilize numerous design styles and techniques in his character design, brand development, and graphic design has garnered him a reputation as a versatile and uniquely talented artist.  He prides himself of his ability to truly listen to the needs of his clients, help them solve problems and construct strong, cohesive brands.
