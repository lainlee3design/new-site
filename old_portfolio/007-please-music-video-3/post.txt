Text: Bobby Bishop is a seasoned hip hop artist from Lynn, Massachusetts, a pretty rough neighborhood by its own right.  I'd followed Bobby over the past few years but never had the opportunity to connect with him personally.  A few months after the release of the "Let's Just" music video I'd completed for Othello, Bobby sent me an email expressing his interest in working together on his next video.  I was elated and we immediately began talking about the prospect of working together.  It wasn't until a year later that Bobby was ready to move forward with the project.  By then, Bobby had a much clearer vision of what his album would sounds like, including the title track that he wanted to do the music video for.  As per my normal process, I had him send me the track and spent a few days brainstorming a rough concept for the video.  For production, Bobby flew out here to Sacramento, and we spent a day filming all of his footage against a green screen at a local production house.  Principal photography took about 9 hours all together, while post-production animation in After Effects took another few months.  At the time I was working a full-time job, so it took a little more time than normal.  In the end, Bobby had a fresh music video for his album launch.  The video received wide praise on several Christian Hip Hop sites and was even voted Video of the Month on the <a href="http://www1.steelroots.com/countdown/">Steelroots Countdown</a>.
