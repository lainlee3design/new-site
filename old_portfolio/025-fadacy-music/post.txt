Text: This was a branding concept I was working on for Fadacy Music in Boston, MA.  Fadacy is a record label run by emcee Applejaxx.  AJ wanted to rebrand his label, but unfortunately didn't really have very much of an idea as to what he wanted to do.  AJ wasn't quite sure what he wanted to see, but definitely knew what he didn't want to see.  After a month or so of unfruitful development, AJ decided to postpone further work until he had a clearer vision for his brand.  This is one of the type treatments I developed for the project.
