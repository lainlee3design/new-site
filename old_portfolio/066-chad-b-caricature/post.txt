Text: I was asked by my buddy Chad Bercea of <a href="http://chadbercea.tumblr.com" target="_blank">ChadMadeMedia</a> to hook up this illustration of him.  Chad hooked up a 3D version of my LL3Dsn logo earlier this year so I owed him a solid, but honestly I had a blast doing it.  Chad sent me a few pics of himself and told me to make sure I included his after-work staples: slouch hat, Tom's shoes, jacket and iPhone or iPad.  I also included his favorite Johnny Cupcakes shirt.
