Text: Okay so let's just get it out there - "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World" was one of the sickest visual effects films of late!  One of my peeves with visual effects is when visual effects are done poorly.  Edgar Wright and his team did an amazing job on the Scott Pilgrim movie and the visual effects were off-the-chain!  In addition, Bryan Lee O'Malley did a great job illustrating the comic book, and the artwork Ubisoft Montreal came up with for the game is totally what inspired this illustration!  It might be showing up in the near future as a t-shirt print...stay tuned ;D
