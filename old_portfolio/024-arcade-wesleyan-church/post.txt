Text: This brand was developed for Arcade Wesleyan Church in Sacramento, CA.  The client was very open stylistically as far as creative direction, and allowed us to develop several different looks for them to choose from.  In one of our early versions, we used a curved brush stroke through the "A" to signify the church's forward movement, growth, and continued development.  The client fell in love with it and it was carried through to the final version of the brand.
