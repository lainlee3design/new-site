Text: Now I'm not a sneakerhead by any means, and I'll be the first to admit that I have never owned a pair of Dunks in my life.  But at the time, a lot of my clients in the music industry did.  I had to create a vector graphic of a pair of Dunks for a client of mine and decided to have a little fun with it after the project was over.  This was not an official design done for Nike and is not endorsed by them, just for clarification.
