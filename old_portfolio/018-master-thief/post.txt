Text: "Master Thief" is an illustration I did under a contract with Joint Medias for a Sacramento x LA-based clothing line, <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foreber-robin.com%2F&amp;ei=rvq5TcLuIpHKiAK0zsS9Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpkLqOUO5QTgET2Sfs578SC_habg&amp;sig2=PqXVHxF5Vl9UQpygpYZ_ZQ" target="_blank">Foreber Robin</a>.  The creative direction was simple, create a fun, cartoony thief running away carrying a box of stolen goods with a light shining on him.  The guys at Joint gave me the brief and let me have at it, and the client was thrilled with the result.  The <strong>Foreber Robin</strong> guys are revamping their site but are launching their new site and collection very soon, so stay tuned!
