Text: This is a short intro I did for Higher Dimension Church in Houston, TX.  The brief was simple: their sermon series was about social networking and they wanted to depict in some way the pastor tweeting or posting on Facebook and increasing his followers.  I immediately knew the best way to convey this message would be through illustration and motion graphics, and I immediately got on illustrating a cartoon version of "Pastor J" and his loyal anonymous followers.  The whole project took about a week to complete, from conceptualization to illustration to compositing.  It was a real pleasant surprise getting a tweet from one of their church members saying how much they enjoyed the video!  That's what it's all about anyway, in the end, I just want to make sure that my clients and the intended audience is entertained.
