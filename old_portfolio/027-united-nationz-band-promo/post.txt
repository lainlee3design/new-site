Text: My brother Landon (aka <a href="http://gobrobot.com" target="_blank">Brobot</a>) and I were blessed with the opportunity to join United Nationz for their first live recording studio session back in December 2010 to film a promo video for them.  This video is to be used at functions they attend as well as on their website, which LainLee3Design has also been commissioned to work on, more on that later.  Our good friend <a href="http://kinmusic.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Kin</a>, a graduate of Expressions College in Berkeley, CA, was also present that evening to assist in the live recording.

This is a rough edit of the promo, as it is still in desperate need of post-production color correction and sound editing (levels and gain).  Due to workload issues on both ends, the project has been temporarily postponed.
