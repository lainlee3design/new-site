Text: OrniThreads is an ornithologically-based clothing company out of the New England area.  This was probably one of the only logo types where I got it exactly right on the first try.  The client sent me a few scanned pages out of an ornithological textbook as well as a few web links.  She said that she wanted the logo to mimic the typeface of a typical ornithology textbook, which is exactly the direction I decided to go in.  This branding was carried through to the rest of OrniThreads identity, including their business cards, online identity, and apparel.  We also developed a few t-shirt designs for them as well, which you can see <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/?type=design" target="_blank">here</a>.
