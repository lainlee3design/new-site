Text: This was an apparel design I was commissioned to design by my late homie, Giovanni Goodman (aka The Chemo Kid).  Gionvanni passed away earlier this year after battling cancer for most of his life.  He spent the last 3 or 4 years building a career as an emcee under the stage name, The Chemo Kid.  This design was for one of his last albums, The Chemical Chronicles.  LainLee3Design was also responsible for the album cover design and the branding for the album.
