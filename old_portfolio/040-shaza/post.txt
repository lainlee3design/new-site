Text: I've always been a huge fan of the dichotomy of the comic book hero who, while having been endowed with the gift of super strength, flight, or any of the other innumerable super-powers in the comic world, struggles with the responsibility of being a decent human. Billy Batson is an iconic example of this duality, this ebb and flow of the hero's struggle.Â  This piece is meant to capture the in-between stage of mortal and god, the moment Billy breaks down as a human and calls upon the mighty power of Shazam. It's a moment I feel like we've all experienced in our own lives, a powerful moment when we realize that though we're only human, we possess a strength greater than the limitations we place upon ourselves. And from time to time, that strength need only a little "Shazam" to unleash itself.
