Text: Bobby Bishop is a seasoned hip hop artist from Lynn, Massachusetts, a  pretty rough neighborhood by its own right.  I’d followed Bobby over the  past few years but never had the opportunity to connect with him  personally.  A few months after the release of the “Let’s Just” music  video I’d completed for Othello, Bobby sent me an email expressing his  interest in working together on his next video.  I was elated and we  immediately began talking about the prospect of working together.  It  wasn’t until a year later that Bobby was ready to move forward with the  project.  By then, Bobby had a much clearer vision of what his album  would sounds like, including the title track that he wanted to do the  music video for.  Bobby wanted an entire media package put together for the release of his last album, "Everyday Man", including a logo for the album, album design, and music video.   Given the scope of the project, we decided to focus first on the identity of the project and start with the look and feel of the album cover first, since that would eventually dictate the mood, look and feel of the video.
