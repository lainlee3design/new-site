Text: C|Five is a re-brand that I developed for the youth ministries for my good friends at <a href="http://calvarychurch.cc">Calvary Church</a> in Irving, TX.  My friend Pastor Jeremy called me back in 2008 with a passion and a vision - a passion for his youth ministry program and a vision to take it to the next level.  He sent me a care package of inspiration from other youth ministries, but mainly left all creative direction in my hands.  After reviewing the "inspirational materials", I realized one thing - they all looked the same.  And if there's one thing I know about Calvary, it's that they are <em><strong>original</strong></em>!  So it was imperative for me to create a brand that was reflective of this originality.  The result was something clean, fun and original that allowed for a lot of flexibility in creating the rest of C|Five's identity, including the <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/?type=motion">promotional video</a> I also did for them.  All-in-all, I had a total blast creating a strong brand for a great group of people, and it remains one of my favorite brands to date.
