Text: My man Othello and I have been collaborating on design projects for his music for years now.  As you may have noticed, he's floating around here on LL3Dsn.com quite a bit.  One of the first things I ever did for him was design a cover for his first mixtape, "Extra Gems", back in 2007.  It's been a few years and Othello wanted to do a follow-up to his first mixtape with "Extra Gems, Vol. II".  He asked me to hook him up with another design.  The first album cover was done years ago, back when my graphic skills were still developing, and was a reflection of my capabilities at that time.  Also, it didn't really have a unifying theme.  This time around, however, I wanted to do something really creative.
