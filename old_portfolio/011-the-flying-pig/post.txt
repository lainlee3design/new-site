Text: This is a brand we worked on developing for a family friend's restaurant in the SF Bay Area.  The design brief was fairly simple - the client wanted something that had a quaint, vintage deli feel with the color palette they provided.  We work-shopped a few designs ideas (which you can see in  the thumbnails below) however in the end, the client chose to go a different route and none of our comps were chosen.
