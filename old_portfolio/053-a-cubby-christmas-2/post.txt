Text: This was a SUPER SPECIAL Christmas present for my sweetheart last year.    When we started dating, I'd made her a little video with my character,  Cubby, dancing with the former Twitter bird (before he became the  Twitter bird).  She loved the video and begged me to finish.  Fast  forward two years later, the dancing Cubby video was never finished!   So  I knew that whenever I <em><strong>did</strong></em> finish it, it'd have to be bigger and much  better than the original!  So I decided to have Cubby go harder with the  dancing, and drew him a few more characters who'd go on to make  reappearances later on in the year.

Created pencils, paper, Illustrator, After Effects, and a whole lot of love!!!
