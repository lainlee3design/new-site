Text: Larry Ewings, aka Jupiter 7, contacted LainLee3Design to hook him up with a fresh album cover for his album, "RockSteady".  He had nothing specific in mind, he just wanted it to be creative, have a fresh, hip-hop vibe, and be reflective of the his home in the Bay Area.  With this open-ended design brief in mind, I went to work.
