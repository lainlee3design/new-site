Text: I was asked by my mom to create a shirt for her cheerleading squad at my sister's high school.  The purpose was to remind students and staff that cheerleading is just as much apart of the school's athletic program as any of the other sports.  The challenge, however, was coming up with something different and fun that both the school would approve and the girls would love.
