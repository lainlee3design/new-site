Text: Othello is the man...period.  I'm always inspired by his lyrics, his enthusiasm and his transparency.  He's a great friend, which is why I love working with him and don't mind going the extra mile sometimes to help him out.  I really see how great he is and want the world to experience him too, he's got a lot to offer.  So when he came out with "Active Balanced" off his latest collabo with DJ Vajra, "The Required Taste", I knew we'd have to put together a video for him!  The original plan was to fly out to Portland, film Othello's parts, then weeks later fly out to LA and film the cats from NowOn and the rest of the pick-up shots.  But as life would have it, it didn't quite work out that way.  Othello and his fam had to move back to Michigan and NowOn was leaving for their European tour.  So what you see is all we were able to shoot.  Still, you get a chance to see how great the full video would've been.  My fiancée helped direct this video and was largely responsible for making this trip happen! Thanks huney ;D
