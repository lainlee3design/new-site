Text: I was commissioned by the manager of <strong>5 &amp; A Dime</strong> to come up with some new branding for the young DJ.  They really like the logo they had been using, but wanted to update it with a little more style and dimension.  More specifically, they wanted something that captured the excitement of 5&amp;AD's on-stage performance and his LED curtain backdrop.  LainLee3Design came up with several comps for their team.  They ultimately chose this design, which comprised of some custom illustrated type and silhouette, as well as another version with more detail.
