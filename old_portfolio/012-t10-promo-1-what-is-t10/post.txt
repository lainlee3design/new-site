Text: My good friend Brandon Middleton is a man of many talents.  To name a few, he is an accomplished musician, an eloquent lyricist, and in a word, a genius.  As an engineer currently working for Cisco Systems, you would think Brandon knows a thing or two about a thing or two.  Turns out he does!  Brandon is the genius behind the new game <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">"Tic Tac Toe Ten"</span></strong> (or T10 for short), a game that is a fusion of strategy and fun, with the look and feel of traditional Tic Tac Toe, but with the strategy of chess.  Brandon and his team have developed the game as applications for the iPhone, iPad, and Android phones and just recently released a free version you can now play online with friends.  <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">LainLee3Design</span></strong> helped Brandon come up with a few promos for the 2010 PTA Conference in Memphis, TN.  I also accompanied Brandon and our friend Brian (one of T10's programmers) to Memphis to help run the booth and educate people about the new game.  We had a fantastic time teach hundreds of people how to play T10, watching their faces light up at that "A-ha!" moment when they realized how to play.  We were ever schooled by some of our more astute opponents (most of them younger than us) who by beating us won themselves free T10 t-shirts.  In the end, the videos were a great educational tool and the game continues to be a hit.  Our hope and prayer is that we can get school districts using the platform to teach their kids subjects in new and engaging ways.

You can check out the game on the T10 website at <a href="http://tictactoeten.com" target="_blank">http://tictactoeten.com</a> and view some of the testimonials we shot on our Flip Cam at last year's PTA Conference here on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tictactoeten#p/a/u/1/KczqY5FAZhw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>.  Cardinal7even™ was a moniker used by myself and photographer <a href="http://squintfoto.com" target="_blank">Squint</a> for joint projects at the time.  Squint was a huge help in the filming of these promotional videos, serving as gaffer and sound grip.
