Text: This was a another personal piece I did for a brand that I was developing a few years ago called <em><strong>Fallible</strong></em>.  The idea behind the line was to showcase emcees whom I felt exemplified the "Fallible" ideology - showing how to be a servant through actions and humility, while recognizing that all of us even at our strongest points, are fallible by nature.  I made this piece for Othello, who subsequently gave me permission to turn the design into a print.
