Text: PocketLabWorks™ is an iPhone/iPad app company responsible for PocketAmp™, PocketSing™, and PocketRap™.  Our client Kevin was in need of branding for his company and his applications.  LainLee3Design handled the branding for all three applications in addition to the umbrella brand.  LainLee3Design also handled the design and layout of all three iPhone and iPad applications - including versions 1 and 2 of PocketAmp™ and the Gallien-Krueger Amp App.  You can view more of the design proofs on our <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/?type=design">Design</a> page.  You can check out the PocketLabWorks™ App Suite on their <a href="http://pocketlabworks.com/home.html" target="_blank">website</a> or in the iTunes App Store.
