Text: Kambui (pr. Kom-boo-ee), aka Signatural, was looking for a fresh, dynamic design for his debut album.  LainLee3Design teamed up with SquintFoto to hook Kambui with an awesome cover design, with SquintFoto hooking up the photography and LainLee3Design handling all of the graphic design.  The project called for a complete visual package for the album release, including album design, posters, flyers, on-stage motion graphics and t-shirt design.  As is my usual routine, we tackled the identity first so that the rest of the collateral material had the same look and feel as the album cover.
