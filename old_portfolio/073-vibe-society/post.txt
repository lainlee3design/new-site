Text: Vibe Society was a project I worked on for JC of Dilemma Marketing in LA.  It was an extensive explorative process, but in the end, we nailed the brand for the client.  This logo was one of the concepts pitched to the client.  While it is not the final concept accepted by the client, it was one of my favorite concepts throughout the process.
