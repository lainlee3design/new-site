Text: Cubby is a character I created for my fiancée when we first started dating.  One night I made a short little video with Cubby doing a little dance.  She fell in love with it and spent the next two years begging me to finish it.  Finally, last Christmas, I decided to stop letting things get in the way of me finishing it, and decided to go all out and make her a Cubby Christmas Special!  My short little video quickly turned into a short film, featuring a gang of custom-crafted characters.  I spent every night for the entire month of December working on the video.  I surprised her with <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8139273/Miscellaneous/Merry_Christmas.m4v" target="_blank">"A Cubby Christmas"</a><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8139273/Miscellaneous/Merry_Christmas.m4v" target="_blank"></a> on Christmas Day!  She loved it so much her cheeks hurt from smiling!  I could say it was totally worth it, but that's not fair, 'cause she's always worth it.
