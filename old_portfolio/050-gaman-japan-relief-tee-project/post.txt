Text: The "GAMAN" Japan Relief Tee Project was LainLee3Design's first charity project back in March/April of 2011.  “GAMAN” is a Japanese word meaning “perseverance and endurance” that became a rally cry for the survivors of the disasters that struck Japan on March 11, 2011.  “GAMAN” is an ideal taught from childhood.  It is a way of looking at the hardships of life with a mindset to always persevere.  It will continue to encourage the Japanese as they begin to heal and rebuild.</br></br>

We took orders for the entire month of March, and over 60 people supported our effort to send aid to the 450,000 Japanese displaced by the earthquake/tsunami disaster.  Their choice to ban together &amp; donate to this cause made “Gaman” more than just a word.  100% of the profits made from the purchase of the LL3Dsn x Gaman Japan Relief Tee were donated equally among three relief aid organizations: The Red Cross, Save the Children, and UNICEF.
