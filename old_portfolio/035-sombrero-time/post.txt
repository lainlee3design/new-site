Text: I was contracted by RND Educational Systems to give their new Spanish language iPad App life and character.  The project originally called for three environments and three main characters.  However, once we got into the project, we quickly learned that there would be much more required to truly bring this project to life.  LainLee3Design spent three months developing custom illustrations for environments, characters, and objects.  We also developed a custom typeface for use in the game as well as a t-shirt design for promotional use.  It was a long and arduous process, but in the end our clients were happy and we are satisfied with the final illustrations.  We can't wait to see it come to life on the iPad!
