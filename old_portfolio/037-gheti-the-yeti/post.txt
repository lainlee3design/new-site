Text: A personal piece done for my fiancée for Valentine's Day this year<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong></strong></span>.  She loved Gheti the Yeti so much in her Cubby Christmas Special video, I decided to make him up as Cupid for Valentine's.  In his snow-stained boots and giant diaper, his was more than a hit!  And he didn't even have to fire any of his arrows!  Boom...winning ;D
