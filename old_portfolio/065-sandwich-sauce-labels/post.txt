Text: I was approached by Krista G. of <a href="http://getkdm.com" target="_blank">GetKDM</a> to design and illustrate some sandwich sauce labels for her client.  This was an insanely fun project for several reasons: first, the names of the sauces lend themselves to crazy creative illustrations; second, there was so much creative freedom (just the way I like it).  In addition to the 5 sauce labels I illustrated, I was also commissioned to illustrate the sandwich chain's owners holding up a massive sub sandwich (or as we called them back East "hoagies").
