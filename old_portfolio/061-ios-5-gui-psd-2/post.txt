Text: This is the first Freebie here that is not made by <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>LainLee3Design</strong></span>.  But with iOS 5 dropping this week, I know a lot of designers (myself  included) could use this awesome little gem here!

&nbsp;

This .PSD was made  possible by the wonderful folks at <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/" target="_blank">Teehan + Lax</a>, an Interactive UX  Design firm out of Toronto.  They've made, in this designer's opinion,  the best looking .PSD GUI elements to date and I've been using them for  any iPhone App designs I've worked on for the last year or so!  Once again they're on point with bringing us the latest updates with the GUI .PSD download, making sure we're up-to-date with the latest elements!  Check out their site <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or download the .PSD below and jump right in!
