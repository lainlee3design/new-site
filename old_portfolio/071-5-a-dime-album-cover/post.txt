Text: I was commissioned by the manager of DJ 5 &amp; A Dime to design the cover to his latest album, "#BASSMOB".  The young dj has developed quite a cult following through the internet, using the hashtag "#BASSMOB" to identify his followers on Twitter.  The "5&amp;AD" team released a viral video earlier this year which featured other members of the team dressed up in Tigger, Spongebob and Elmo mascot costumes.  5&amp;AD's manager wanted to feature these characters on the cover alongside 5 &amp; A Dime leading their #BASSMOB to his next concert.  They were very happy with the result.
