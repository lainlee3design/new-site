Text: In honor of the premiere of <a href="http://super8-movie.com/" target="_blank">Super 8</a> today, I’m offering this print as a FREE desktop wallpaper for your  download and viewing pleasure!  As an homage to J.J., I  have also included several glyphs at the bottom of the print, serving  as clues to the different projects J.J. has worked on and entertained us  with over the years.  See if you can figure out what each one  represents!

&nbsp;

The wallpaper is available for download in 3 different screen sizes:

<a href="http://db.tt/NsONGns" target="_blank">1920 x 1280</a> |  <a href="http://db.tt/ba8ts3s" target="_blank">1440 x 900</a> |  <a href="http://db.tt/JsTOUM3" target="_blank">1024 x 768</a>

&nbsp;

I had a lot of fun making this and hope you enjoy it as well!  Cheers and see you at the movies!
