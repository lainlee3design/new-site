Text: Lady Lavish is an online boutique specializing in providing products for the more sophisticated shopper.  My clients contacted me in need of a strong brand with which they'd planned to launch their e-commerce store and viral marketing campaigns.  They provided me with some visual references for creative direction and knew that they wanted something classy with a vintage "cameo"-esque feel.  Lady Lavish is still a "Project-In-Progress", so stay tuned for more updates.
