Text: This was an exciting project because it was the first project my brother and I got to collaborate professionally on a logo.  LainLee3Design was responsible for the illustration of the baby, while my brother was responsible for the type treatment and layout.  The client wanted the illustration of the baby to resemble her infant son, who the company was named after.  In the end, she was more than pleased with what we came up with for her, and to top it off, we had a lot of fun working together on this project.
