Text: I was commissioned by Artistic Liquid to work on the brand for Gospel Planet, a Christian Dating site.  Working through several concepts, the client liked this brand mark the best, as it hinted at the image of a planet while using the negative space to make an initial "G".  They wanted to keep everything clean and simple, and in the end they were very happy with the outcome.
