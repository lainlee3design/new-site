Text: This is another piece done for a Valentine's Day greeting card.  I based the characters off of Michael Cera and Alia Skawkat's characters from the hilarious sitcom "Arrested Development" (not to be confused with the soul/hip hop group of the same name - they are legally required to make that distinction...get it?).  This particular scene is from the episode titled "Marta Complex", in which Michael Cera's character "George Michael" (not the other one, you know, the singer-songwriter) has a crush on his cousin "Maeby" and spends his entire time at his family's Valentine's Day party trying to find her a candied heart that expressed exactly how he feels. He finds one that reads "Maybe Tonight", thinking it's a sign, when really, it's their most popular candy.
