Text: Though the name can seem a bit misleading, "Need-A-Wife" was a fun brand to develop.  Knowing that the main point of their business was to provide households with extra assistance in many different areas, whether it be housekeeping, taxes, carpooling, etc. we had a vision of "Need-A-Wife" being like a gift from the 40s &amp; 50s.  With a throwback, vintage typeface, a few flourishes and a custom pattern incorporating feather dusters and hearts, and a custom illustration of a housewife/maid figure vacuuming with the "F", the nostalgic look ended up working very well for the "Need-A-Wife" brand.  It helped detract so much from the name and add to the allure.
