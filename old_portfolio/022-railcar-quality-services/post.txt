Text: Branding for a transportation inspection &amp; quality assurance company.  The client had been using a clip-art .gif as their logo for an extended amount of time and was in need of an updated look.  Although the client deals with several different types of public transportation (light rail, heavy rail, buses, etc.), we determined that the light rail imagery was the best to carry their brand.  With companies in their line of work looking a little too corporate and out-dated, we wanted to make sure RQS had a more contemporary, stream-lined look.
