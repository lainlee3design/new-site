Text: Remnant Church was brand new to the area when pastor Mark approached me about helping him update his church's identity.  The beauty of this project was twofold: (1) they already had a solid foundation with their initial identity concept, and (2) they were very clear on communicating what they were looking for.  I composed several versions of the identity to look at, and they provided me with great feedback to help me clearly hone in on what they wanted.  In the end, they loved what I delivered and were please with how their new identity was able to help them effectively spread the word about their new church.  This identity was used on flyers, business cards, and on their website.
