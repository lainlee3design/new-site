Text: This is a brand we worked on developing for a clothing brand for twins.  It was rather challenging at first because we had to come up with something that did not distinguish between male and female but also did not favor any particular race.  Initially, we started with two Italian-American cartoon characters, but that was a problem because of both race and gender.  We tossed around several ideas, from trees to animals, but we felt that all of those had been done before with infant product brands.  We decided to go with unhatched eggs in diapers and the client loved it!  We had a lot of fun working on this brand.  The logo was used on the tags for their clothes and on their identity and their <a href="http://unodueclothingfortwins.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.
