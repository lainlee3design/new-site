Text: This is a brand developed for Velocity Church in San Francisco, CA.  Velocity will be the first church to open its doors on a newly developed Treasure Island.  Pastor Kareem contacted LL3Dsn in desperate need of some brand development for his new church.  As Velocity Church is aimed at a young adults and families, he needed something that was contemporary in design but stood out at the same time as being different than other churches.  Later, we determined that he also needed something that was versatile enough to serve as an icon and also be shortened for their nickname, "V-City".
