Text: This was a brand developed for a Men's Retreat through St. Paul Missionary Baptist in Sacramento.  They had been using a clip art .gif of a spartan warrior and needed something more custom to beef up the quality of the design.  Originally, we designed a fully-illustrated version of a dynamic spartan warrior.  While the client loved the design, he didn't feel that it properly fit the demographic of his older congregation.  We then decided to tone down the style a little and go with more of a simple, modern design which the client <em>loved</em>!
