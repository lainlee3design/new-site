Text: A Penny for Your Thoughts is a Military Mental Health Initiative.  Essentially it's a penny drive to raise money to help veterans of war who suffer from various mental health issues.  My client wanted to come up with a brand but didn't know what she wanted, only that she wanted to it to be clean and to make an impact.  I remember seeing an image of a soldier in Afghanistan knelt down to pray and something about it stuck out to me.  I wanted to have a child placing a penny in the head of the praying soldier, like a piggy bank.  To this day A Penny for Your Thoughts remains one of my favorite brands that I've worked on and I hope one day, their mission will be globally recognized, helping give back to those who've sacrificed so much for us.
