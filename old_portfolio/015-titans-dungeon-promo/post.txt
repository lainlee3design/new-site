Text: I was commissioned by <a href="http://jointmedias.com" target="_blank">Joint Medias</a> out of Sacramento to produce a promo video for Titan's Dungeon, an MMA/Boxing gym in Auburn, CA.  The video was for use on the gym's website, designed and programmed by Joint Medias.  All principle photography was shot on location in Auburn over an 8-hour period.  Joint Medias and I collaborated on the concept of the video, basing our visual style on Titan's buzz words, "Edgy, grungy, 'in-your-face'".  Ron from Joint Medias was actually on-location to help with the filming (he served as gaffer and grip for the day).  The footage was then edited in Adobe Premiere and the title shots were created in After Effects.  Titan, his head trainer Rob, and his wife, Gina, all make appearances in the video.
