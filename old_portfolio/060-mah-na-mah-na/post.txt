Text: "Mah Na Mah Na" is currently a work-in-progress.  It all started with the song, which if you don't know is composed by Piero Umiliani, famous for his awesome "go-go" lounge music of the 60s.  He's also responsible for this<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2oPr922-o0" target="_blank"> amazing number</a>.  "Mah Na Mah Na" was originally written by Umiliani for an Italian movie called "Sweden: Heaven and Hell", but was made popular when used in the first episode of The Muppet Show and then in The Benny Hill Show.  This was just a fun animation project that allowed me to work on comedic timing and facial expressions.  Truthfully, it was inspired by <a href="http://www.yuki-7.com/blog.php" target="_blank">Kevin Dart's "Yuki 7 and the Gadget Girls"</a> and the art of the 1960s.  As an artist and designer, I'm constantly entrigued by different art styles and am constantly my hand at different styles to stay sharp and as versatile as possible.  I hope you enjoy!
