Text: <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>C|Five</strong></span> is the name of the youth ministries at Calvary Church in Fort Worth, TX.  I love working with Calvary, mainly because they're always clear in what they want and fully trust my creative input.  But they're also just really cool and fun people!  Back in 2008, I had the amazing opportunity to be given full creative freedom to completely rebrand the ministry and give it a fresh, fun, and youthful look for 2009.  To introduce the new brand, Pastors Jeremy and Ben wanted me to create a promo video explaining what the mission of the ministry was and why they were giving it a new face.  The process began in April with the visual aspects of the project, and we nailed the branding and identity down shortly thereafter.  After that, I focused on compositing this video which took about a month straight to complete.  To this day I don't believe I've completed another mograph video with so many moving parts.  It was quite the undertaking, but I was told that it was received with ginormous success and excitement, and for me, that's what it's all about - exceeding the client's expectations and delivering a product that fulfills its intended purpose.
