Text: A personal piece done for my line of cards and prints, <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>III Cards &amp; Prints</strong></span>.  This was originally created as a Valentine's Day card and will most likely premiere as such next year.  You can currently purchase this as an 18x24" print on 80# cover in the <a href="http://lainlee3design.bigcartel.com" target="_blank">III Store</a>.
