Text: Every child of the 80's remembers He-Man and his faithful feline companion Battle Cat, riding in to save the day from the evil forces of Skeletor. By the power of Greyskull, Prince Adam would unsheath his trusty sword, hold it valiantly to the sky, and yell, "I have the power!", instantaneously transforming him into the mighty warrior He-Man.Â  But what we don't know too much of is who He-Man was as a boy. Here we get a glimpse of the young warrior He-Boy and his faithful power-cat Battle Kit.
