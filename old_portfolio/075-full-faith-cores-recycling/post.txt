Text: This was a logo I was commissioned by Joint Medias to work on.  The client wanted something clean and classic, something that harkened back to a simpler time in America's history, and something that hinted at hot rods and body shops.  After coming up with the initial type, it was requested to add a few auto parts that reflect their main business.
