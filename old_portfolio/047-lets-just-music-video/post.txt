Text: <strong>"Let's Just"</strong> will forever live on in my memory as a video of many "firsts".  Not only was it my directorial debut in the music video genre, but it was also my very first<em><strong> big</strong></em> mograph project altogether!  I was basically learning After Effects while working on this video, which was highly rewarding after it was completed, but utterly nerve-shattering during post-production!  This video was also the first time my now good friend Othello and I met in person after spending months communicating via phone and email about this and many other collaborative efforts.  He and his wife, along with our friend Poems, drove up to NorCal while on tour to spend one 14-hour day shooting this with us.  My buddy Travis Nutter was kind enough to lend us his camera and help out as DP, providing some great insight into the project and helping me out when I needed it.  Being a very ambitious artist, my initial concept for the video was unfortunately too large in scale for a one-man editing team, despite us being able to capture all of the footage necessary.  But that's exactly how I was taught to view the possibilities of things - reach for the stars first, <em>then</em> scale you idea down from there to what's reasonable.  But after a solid moth of 14-16-hour editing blocks, working 6-7 days-a-week, and with the help of Othello (and quite frankly by the grace of God), the video came out looking just as good as, if not better than, my original concept.

Let's Just has appeared on several online music video venues and has been screened on MTV Japan and music stations in Germany and Michigan.
