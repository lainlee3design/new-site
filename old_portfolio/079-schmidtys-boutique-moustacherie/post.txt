Text: This was a fun personal project, since I seem to be in love with the vintage gentleman.  I remember sketching this one day at my old job during some down time.  I got home that night, cleaned it up in Illustrator, and came up with a fake boutique it belonged to.  I don't know, might be a good idea for a real place someday, right?
