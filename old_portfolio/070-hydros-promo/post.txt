Text: This was a very fun project just recently completed (12.5.11) for the good folks over at Hydros Water, LLC. in Philly, PA.  They needed a promo video for their new clean water filter water bottle, showing their customers (and educating the world) about how much of a carbon footprint a single bottle of water leaves on the world.  Hydros provided the basic creative direction, and LainLee3Design handled the storyboarding, direction, illustration, animation and audio (voice-over and music selection) for the piece.
