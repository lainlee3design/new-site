Text: This was a personal piece I did a shortly after the last election.  The vector graphic of President Obama was done while I was working at my last 9-5, which my boss gave me permission to use on my site.  I never did anything with this piece, since there was already an overabundance of Obama-related art prints at the time.  The piece features on of my favorite lines from his 2008 "Super Tuesday" speech.
