Text: I've been designing t-shirts for years.  Throughout my career, I've thought about starting a clothing line only about 80 thousand times!  The only problem is starting and maintaining a full blown brand is a full-time job within itself.  Though I've had several solid ideas for brands, I feel it would be more productive investing my time in building up my LL3Dsn brand and releasing teesthrough that.  I'd much rather be a design firm that releases great t-shirts as promotional tools for our brand than an indie brand that's trying to keep its head above water in the sea of indie brands.  That's the game plan at least, and I'm hoping to see 2012 to be the year I launch some really fun, exclusive designs!  Stay tuned!
