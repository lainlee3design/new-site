Text: Helllo everyone!

Well, as many of you may know, it has been an awful long-time coming.  Over a year in the making, the new LainLee3Design.com is finally live and I'm SO freakin' excited!!!  Thanks to my friends at <a href="http://codemyconcept.com">Code My Concept</a>, I now have a full portfolio site and blog where I can post my design and motion work and share with the world what I find interesting!  I'm so excited I don't know where to start first!

Though the site is up and running, it's not officially "Up".  I still have a lot of work to do populating the portfolio with examples of my work and making sure all of the links are functional.  But I'm very excited to share everything with you all and can't wait until everything has been fully uploaded!

In the mean time, sit back and have a look around!  There's enough "filler" here for you to get a sense of what the site will look like when it's finished!  Feel free to leave any comments here on the Blllogâ„¢ or drop me a line any time you feel like it!

Peace. L3.
