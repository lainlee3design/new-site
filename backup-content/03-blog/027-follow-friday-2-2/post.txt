Text: What's good party people?  This week's Follow Friday post revolves  around some of the freshest indie t-shirt lines out there right now!   I've had the pleasure of connecting with almost all of the folks  featured here personally and really not only believe in the designs  they're pushing forward but the heart that goes into each and every  product they release.  Check them out!

<a href="http://www.rdqlusgoodsandcloth.com" target="_blank"><strong>RDQLUS Goods &amp; Cloth</strong></a>: Hvy Crwn Official - <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rdqlus_creative" target="_blank">@rdqlus_creative</a>
Run by the insanely gifted veteran graphic designer and foremost authority on all things freelance, Steve Gordon Jr., <strong>RDQLUS G &amp; C</strong> is Steve's signature, hand-tailored line paying homage to his home town  of Omaha, Nebraska!  Possible collabo with LL3Dsn &amp; fresh, original  designs from RDQLUS coming soon (spoiler alert, <a href="http://dribbble.com/rdqlus" target="_blank">they look SIIIICK</a>)!

<a href="http://www.andwellington.com/" target="_blank"><strong>&amp;Wellington</strong></a><strong> - </strong><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/andwellington" target="_blank">@andwellington</a>
<strong>&amp;Wellington</strong> is a very special line run by my good friend Michael Martinho.  The line is in honor of his mother, Avelina Marie Parreira, who was murdered in a violent domestic dispute.  The line seeks to raise awareness about domestic violence and the fatal results of letting it go unchecked.  A truly inspiration brand that keeps it simple when it comes to design, emphasizing their core brand strategy of "It's black or white, not grey."   <strong>

<strong>Monsieur Eureka</strong> I don't know too much about because their site is all in French, but from what I've seen of their quirky, mad scientist style, I've liked.  Fresh illustrations on the tees, just all-around fun.

<strong>Yema Yema</strong> is the brainchild of Mercedes Crespo.  Her illo's are sick and definitely have their own flare, which is what draws me to Yema Yema!

<a href="http://www.localadvancers.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Local Advancers</strong></a> - <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LocalAdvancers" target="_blank">@localadvancers</a><a href="http://www.andwellington.com/" target="_blank"><strong></strong></a>
<strong>Local Advancers </strong>is run by 16-yr-old entrepreneur Peter Takis, probably the most enterprising teenager anyone will ever meet!  Peter runs L.A. out of his parent's house and is far beyond his years!  A great business man with a line I KNOW we'll be seeing much more from very soon (May 1st...mark it down ;D)

<strong>Elektrek Clothing</strong>, the homies from up North (Canada, eh?) haha!  Actually, Monsieur Eureka and Local Advancers are also from Canadia ;D  I've grown to get to know the Elektrek crew a little bit this year and love our back-n-forth banter on Twitter!  We're planning a LL3Dsn x Elektrek collabo for early this year (it's already drawn, just needs to be inked and finalized) and I can't wait to see it when it's done!  Great people over at Elektrek, fun designs for your everyday occasion!  Check em' out!

Well that's it for this week!  Know of a dope indie clothing brand that's defying the rules and redefining fresh, let me know about them by leaving a comment with their info here!  I'll feature them in the upcoming Follow Friday posts about clothing!  In the meantime, stay frsh ;D
