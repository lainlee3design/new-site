Text: What's that 3D freshness you see?!  Just wanted to share the latest LL3Dsn collabo, a first-time venture with Chad from <a href="http://chadbercea.tumblr.com/">ChadMadeMedia</a>.  Chad is a web designer and motion graphics artist based out of Berkeley, CA.  He hooked up the LL3Dsn logo in 3D this weekend on Cinema 4D.  Check Chad out at <a href="http://chadbercea.tumblr.com/">http://chadbercea.tumblr.com/</a> and follow him on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/chadbercea">#chadbercea</a>.
