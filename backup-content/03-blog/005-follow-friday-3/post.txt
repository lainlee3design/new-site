Text: Hey guys, I'm back after a week's hiatus with another #FF collection!  This week it's all about resources - from creative communities to graphic resources &amp; tutorials to business!  These are all links &amp; resources that I've found to be helpful and inspirational on a regular basis!  Check out the list and links below and have a great weekend!

<a href="http://www.zerply.com/" target="_blank">Zerply</a> - Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/zerply" target="_blank">@zerply</a>
<strong>Zerply</strong> is a creative community and resume site where you can easily present yourself to a professional collective.  A great way to mix and mingle among creative professionals around the world.  Though <strong>Zerply</strong> is still fairly new it's constituency is growing daily!  Check it out and join the crew!

<a href="http://designmoo.com/" target="_blank">DesignMoo</a> - Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/designmoo" target="_blank">@designmoo</a>
<strong>DesignMoo</strong> is another creative community for sharing graphic resources with other creative professionals.  From vector graphics to PSDs, web design graphics, textures &amp; backgrounds, you name it, <strong>DesignMoo</strong> has a little something for everyone!  And with <strong>DesignMoo</strong> also being fairly new with it's membership growing exponentially, it's definitely a resource worth checking out.  But you have to be invited to join though, so <a href="mailto:lain3@lainlee3design.com" target="_blank">hit me up</a> if you want an invite (but you hafta ask nice and offer me something in exchange ;P)!

<a href="http://vectips.com" target="_blank">Vectips</a> - Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Vectips" target="_blank">@vectips</a>
<strong>Vectips</strong> is a GREAT place to go for weekly vector illustration inspiration!  <strong>Ryan Putnam</strong> does an amazing job of updating the site weekly with fresh graphics from around the interwebz!  Scouring sites such as DeviantArt and the Behance Network, Ryan has an uncanny ability of sifting through the seemingly endless sea of artists and extracting "The League of Extraordinary" every week!  Definitely worth a checking into and a follow ;D  You can also follow Ryan's other Twitter, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/VectorMill" target="_blank">@VectorMill</a> (a vector resource repository) or his personal one, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rypearts" target="_blank">@RypeArts</a>.

<a href="http://roninapp.com" target="_blank">Ronin</a> - Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/roninapp" target="_blank">@roninapp</a>
I've Blllogged about <strong>Ronin</strong> before, but it's definitely worth repeating!  <strong>Ronin</strong> has been a God-send when it comes to professional, easy-to-use, customizable, beautiful invoicing.  As a designer, I've tried many different invoicing services, because it's more than just ink on paper, it's about the aesthetic and design of the invoice as well.  <strong>Ronin </strong>does a great job of providing quality, professional invoicing services at a great monthly price!  Their attention to details, such as the myriad of options they provide for doing business, make using their app a dream!  Check them out and take the stress out of your invoicing process!

<a href="http://thegoldenblack.com/" target="_blank">TheGolden/Black</a> - No Twitter, but worth checking out
<strong>The Golden/Black</strong> is a collective of some of the dopest vector artists out there right now, including <strong>Hydro74</strong>, <strong>Jimiyo</strong>, and <strong>Pale Horse</strong>.  Through <strong>The Golden/Black</strong>, this collective of artists sells custom vector packs and fonts.  Great selection of a variety of vector and font resources, though the vectors tend to be very stylized, so you might want to save these for your more creatively lenient projects ;P

<a href="http://the99percent.com" target="_blank">The 99%</a> - Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/the99percent" target="_blank">@the99percent</a>
<strong>The 99%</strong> has also been featured here on the <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>Blllog™</strong></span> before, but is also worth reiterating.  <strong>Scott Belsky's</strong> philosophy of "It's not about ideas, it's about making ideas happen" has really been an inspiration to me this year!  I'm almost through with his<strong> "Making Ideas Happen"</strong> book (highly recommend) and frequent <strong>The 99%</strong> quite regularly.  It's a great place to go and hear creative professionals divulge wisdom about the solopreneurial industry and about how to take action and make your ideas happen.  Think TED but strictly for creative professionals!
