Text: I'm a strong advocate of many things in life: fair treatment of animals, veganism, vegetarianism, equal rights for all peoples...and clean water.  In fact, I feel so strongly about the latter that I started my own clean water cause two years ago called <a href="http://OneTwoFifty.org" target="_blank">OneTwoFifty.org</a>.  For $25, you can give someone in need in the world clean drinking water FOR LIFE.  Now just THINK about that: on average, American families use an average of 100 gallons A DAY!!!  That's water from the tap, shower, toilet, sink, etc.  That doesn't even include the water you purchase by the gallon from Safeway!

Matt Damon is one of my role models - as an actor, a human being, and an advocate for clean drinking water.  I've learned a lot about the clean water crisis through him and his charity, <a href="http://water.org" target="_blank">water.org</a>, and about the infinite need for clean drinking water in third world and developing nations.  Even domestically, clean drinking water isn't always a commodity.  Think about Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and how Americans were in dire need of clean drinking water when their streets become flooded with pollution.  Clean drinking water is the solution to many of the world's health issues, and the lack of it is also the cause of many of those issues.

November 19th last year was World Toilet Day.  Unfortunately, I was unable to do anything more than just tweet about it and post about it on my Facebook.  But hopefully, that was something.  The problem is, no one knew it was World Toilet Day!  Much like no one probably knows that March 22, 2013 is World Water Day!  "So what?!" you might say?  "I'm only one person, what can I do to make an impact?"  I'll tell you what.

For the price of any of the following (a meal for two, one evening's worth of groceries, a new shirt, a pair of jeans, an iPad case), you can go to <a href="http://water.org" target="_blank">water.org</a> or <a href="http://strikewithme.org" target="_blank">strikewithme.org</a> and make a one-time donation of $25.  That's it!  Twenty-five smackeroonis will give one person clean drinking water FOR LIFE.  You can die knowing that you helped someone else in the world out in your lifetime, that you directly impacted someone's life!  It's not hard.

Matt Damon's decided to take it a step further though.  He has vowed to cease going to the bathroom until EVERYONE has clean drinking water.  Don't believe me?  See for yourself ;D

Solving the water crisis isn't like solving world hunger, it's much more feasible and is MUCH more pressing.  A human of average physical health can go 3 weeks without food.  However, the same person would only last (about) 3 days without water.  $25 is all it takes to make an impact for one person.  $250 makes an impact for an entire community.  Think about it.
