Text: I just recently finished an ambitious new illustration, celebrating the upcoming release of Marvel's "Avengers" movie! Since I was going to be spending such a long time at the computer, and I had all day to just enjoy doing this illustration, I figured I'd do a time lapse of the process.  This was my first time lapse video and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was remarkably easy to do!  If you have any of the latest versions of Quicktime Pro, "Screen Recording" is built right into the app.  The compression and quality of the captures is great too!  Check it out!

The plan is to release this illustration as a III Brand Limited Edition tee for the May release of "Avengers".  I will be getting it printed on Mens and Womens tees.  If you're interested in one, email me at <a href="mailto: lain3@lainlee3design.com">lain3@lainlee3design.com</a>!
