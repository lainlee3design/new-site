Text: Every 80s kid remembers one thing above all else - how AWESOME the cartoons were!  They were full of so much imagination and wonder, but at the same time allowed us as the viewers to use our imaginations to fill in the plot holes and story gaps with our own interpretations!  I think that was mainly due to most of the cartoons in the 80s were based on toys, which made the series were short-lived and never really finished, so we were always left wanting more.  One of my all-time favorites though had to be Thundercats!!!  Lion-O, Cheetara, Panthro, Tygra, Wily-Kit and Wily-Kat, Snarf, and Mum-Ra - who could forget such classic and creative characters?

While the original Thundercats will never die in our hearts (hearing the original Lion-O's "Thundercats, HOOOOO!" still give me chills), this new iteration shows much promise and I think it's much needed for the kids of today.  Despite its shelf life, it will undoubtedly be a refreshing break from the normal, mundane, poorly drawn cartoons they subject kids to these days.
