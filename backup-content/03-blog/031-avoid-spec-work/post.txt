Text: We've all been there - as a solopreneur you've been asked at least once to do some design work for a prospective client, friend or obscure relative with the promise of exposure, future work, future wealth, or as a pitch in hopes that the client might choose your work.  While this is a scenario every designer must experience when starting out, it's a rather insulting experience for a seasoned professional, one that I myself feel I shouldn't have to address any longer at this point of my career.  But having just recently experienced a miscommunication with a repeat client as well as having walked away from another project with the promise of "good exposure", I thought that these experiences would be pertinent to share with my fellow solopreneur designers who may not yet know the horrors and dangers of (cue voice-over guy from Thriller) <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">"Spec Work"</span></strong>.

Concerning the first case, the breakdown in communication occurred when it was assumed that I would be providing them with work that was of a "speculative" nature.  Because it was I who approached them about a certain project, it was tacitly inferred that it was my responsibility to provide them with a visual proposal or example of the end product of the proposed project.  While I've since cleared up any such confusion with them over the matter (turns out they may have just wanted to see other examples of my work), I still couldn't help but feel that this was a great opportunity to look into how the design community views speculative work, or "spec work", and what type of impact it has on the communication design industry as a whole.

During my research, I came across a very insightful article published by <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">AIGA</span></strong>, the professional association for design.  Founded in 1914, AIGA remains the oldest and largest professional membership organization for design.  Their article on their stance on spec work not only validated the concerns I had with the idea, but affirms how spec work damages not only client/designer relations, but also the design community as a whole.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>"AIGA...believes that  professional designers should be compensated fairly for the value of  their work and should negotiate the ownership or use rights of their  intellectual and creative property through an engagement with clients.  AIGA acknowledges that speculative work—that is, work done prior to  engagement with a client in anticipation of being paid—occurs among  clients and designers. Instead of working speculatively, AIGA strongly  encourages designers to enter into projects with full engagement to  continue to show the value of their creative endeavor. Designers and  clients should be aware of all potential risks before entering into  speculative work."</em></p>
One point AIGA strives to make abundantly clear is that "spec work" is not the same as uncompensated design work.  "Spec Work" is work done specifically with hopes of getting paid for it.  Uncompensated design work comes in several other forms, such as volunteer work, competitions, internships, or pro bono work.  It's also important to understand that there are different stances on spec work between different industries.  In certain design disciplines, such as architecture, advertising, and film &amp; television, professionals have been  expected to participate in speculative work.  AIGA observes that this practice usually occurs in  fields where it is understood that the initial design is not the final product, but is  followed by an extended financial engagement to refine or execute a design.  In this case, it is therefore at least tacitly understood that there will be a future engagement or compensation for the spec work done.  In communications design, this is often not the case. The design  submitted “on spec” is all that the client is seeking.

While spec work is nothing that physically harms a designer (besides the lack of sleep and nourishment you might experience working your ass off for no reward), it is by no means the end of the world.  And as a contract-based designer, it is your job to educate your client/potential client about the nature of spec work and how it damages your working relationship.  Some clients simply do not realize that what they're asking for is a faux pas in your industry, and it's your job to clarify for them.  You owe it to yourself and to other contract-based designers they might work with in the future.  Conversely, also be on alert because there are some clients who are fully aware of what they're asking of you, and they're blatant disrespect of your time, effort, profession, and professionalism should not be tolerated.  Never be afraid to say "No" to a potential client.  Have the faith that when a window is closed a door is opened and you will see more work opportunities in the future.  I can personally attest to this method.  It works.

But take the time to educate yourself on why spec work is a negative thing for you as a contract-based designer.  According to AIGA, clients and designers who're knowingly engaged in spec work share the  responsibility of understanding the potential risks and rewards:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>• Clients risk compromised quality</strong></span> as little time, energy   and thought can go into speculative work, which precludes the most   important element of most design projects—the research, thoughtful   consideration of alternatives, and development and testing of prototype   designs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>• Designers risk being taken advantage of</strong> </span>as some clients   may see this as a way to get free work; it also diminishes the true   economic value of the contribution designers make toward client’s   objectives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>• There are legal risks for both parties</strong></span> should aspects of intellectual property, trademark and trade-dress infringements become a factor.</p>
Freelance Designer <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>Ben Crick</strong></span> has crafted an eloquent, lighthearted "Designer's Manifesto" which is available on his <a href="http://www.behance.net/BenCrick" target="_blank">Behance</a> page.  In it, Ben outlines the benefits of design for the communication industry and defines some principles us contract-based designers should live by.  One of those principles or precepts is to "Avoid Spec Work Like the Plague".  According to Ben, spec work <em>"produces superficial design, wastes your time, and cheapens your work.   You wouldn't tell a hairdresser that you would only pay if the haircut  was good, why design for a client who is not committed to paying."</em> Though very simple, this example is very poignant.  Anyone in the service industry would not stand for their customers only paying if the result or end-product was deemed as being good enough to pay for, so why would your client expect anything different from you.

The world of contract-based design is changing rapidly.  With the industry growing at an astounding rate, more and more industries are relying upon the contract-based workforce to provide them with quality, professional design.  It is therefore important that we as professional solopreneurs take ourselves and our profession extremely seriously, and to hold ourselves and our clients accountable to respect our work, our time, and our profession.
