Text: As one of my favorite historical figures, Abraham Lincoln was already a bad-ass in my eyes.  When I heard about the new 20th Century Fox movie "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" coming out this summer, I was a little skeptical.  But after seeing the awesome movie poster, my faith began to slowly rebuild.  Check out the trailer for "Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter" below, directed by <a href="http://http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0067457/" target="_blank">Timur Bekmambetov</a> of WANTED fame, executive produced by Tim Burton and starring <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0907548/" target="_blank">Benjamin Walker</a> as good ol' Honest Abe.

In honor of the movie, I was even inspired to design a t-shirt based on the upcoming film, giving me a chance to marry my man Lincoln with some fun illustration of vicious vampires and axes, a popular illustrated item this year!  I am planning to release the shirt close to the film's release as a limited edition print through my new website endeavor<strong></strong>.  The design isn't finalized yet, but here's a peek at what's to come.  What do you think?  Be sure to "Like" or "Tweet" if you'd like to see this shirt printed!
