As many of my close friends know, I call myself the Steel Town Native, a moniker I came up with to celebrate my pride in being from Pittsburgh, PA.  Though I've called California home for the majority of my life, I will always be a Steel Town Native.  Both sides of my family were born and raised in The Burgh, and it will forever hold a super special place in my heart.  One of the most meaningful connections I've personally made, however, has been through my late great grandfather, Lain Lee, Sr...the man who began the legacy.

My Grandfather Lain passed two short years before I was born, but ever since I was a wee tike and could hold a crayon, I've always looked to him as a celebrated figure, a keystone in my family's history.  Grandfather Lain was many things, but was known for being an amazingly talented sign painter.  When I was old enough to understand that I was named after him and had inherited his artistic abilities, I have always strived to (and continue to strive to) make him proud and carry on his legacy as an artist.  Grandfather Lain was an amazing man and accomplished many things in his lifetime.

The Lee family is full of versatile and talented people: lawyers, architects, electrical engineers, singers, dancers, all-star athletes, artists, musicians, etc.; and in some way, shape, form or fashion we all attribute our talent to the magnificent genes God infused in Grandfather Lain (not to exclude the matriarch of our family, my beautiful and wise Grandma Lucy).  In his time here on Earth, he was an electrician, a boxer, an illustrator, sign painter, constable inspector, politician (first Black man to run for office in Pittsburgh), fire fighter (he saved a woman from a burning building), husband, father, and entrepreneur.  In short, he was truly a "jack of ALL trades".

Earlier this week, my dad sent me some awesome photos taken by an esteemed Pittsburgh photographer, Teenie Harris.  Between the 1930's and the 1980's (possibly through to the 90's), Mr. Harris photographed celebrities who visited Pittsburgh's Black Community, "The Hill District".  The photographs below are of some of my Grandfather Lain's handiwork.  As a designer, it was SO amazing for me to see that my Grandfather had an awesome command of lettering and typography - and ALL done by hand!  True "old school"!  I'm always looking to vintage signage for inspiration with typography, and getting to see signs my Grandfather Lain painted back in the 40's and 50's is surreal!  I truly hope I'm making him proud with my typography skills.

In the 2nd sign for "Eddie's Restaurant" my Grandfather Lain did both the painting and made the neon signs in the window.  Eddie's Restaurant was also one of his hang-outs and was the location of a scene from a Broadway stage play written by a Pittsburgh Playwright about 10 years ago about "The Hill District" in Pittsburgh.  One of the characters in the play was a big sign painter; my Grandfather.

This brief post is a tribute to the memory of my Grandfather Lain - jack of all trades and Lee Family keystone.  I love you grandpa, I hope I've made you proud with all that I do and all that I am, and pray we get to meet one day.

A HUGE special thanks to my hero, my dad Lain Jr., for providing me not only with the photos of Lee family history, but with the bounty of stories about my lineage and grandfather.  You've always done so much to carry on his legacy in your own way - raising an amazing family and being an amazing father to us all, teaching us SO much.  As I've said many times, I can only pray I'm half the dad you've been to me and my sibs.  I love you SO much man!  You too, in case you didn't know, are also "The Fantastic Mr. Lee" ;D
