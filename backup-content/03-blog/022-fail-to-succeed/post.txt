Text: Like most great inventors, James Dyson is comfortable with failure.  Thomas Edison failed at getting the perfect mixture of chemicals to make the filament for his first light bulb over 9,000 times.  When  interviewed by a young reporter who boldly asked Mr. Edison if he felt like a failure and if he thought he should just give up by now, Edison replied perplexed, "Young man, why would I feel like a failure? And why would I ever give up? I now know definitively over 9,000 ways that an electric light bulb will not work. Success is almost in my grasp." And shortly after that, and over 10,000 attempts, Edison invented the light bulb.  Scott Belsky, author of "Making Ideas Happen", even speaks of the necessity of embracing failure as a part of the creative process:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2296df;">"Most of us have a hard time with failure because we feel not only the professional loss but also the personal hurt when our idea fails to gain traction.  But this tendency poses a grave problem as we commit ourselves to act without conviction and kill ideas liberally.  By doing so, we will meet many dead ends.  Projects that encounter, or end with, failure have great value, but only if we can recognize it and reap the benefits." (Scott Belsky, "Making Ideas Happen", pg. 206)</span></p>
In a recent interview for Wired magazine, Dyson admits that much like Edison and countless inventors before him, he is indeed now comfortable with failing, and you have to be.  In the article, Dyson breaks down the creative process that went into creating the  bag-free, "cyclone technology" design, including the 15 years and 5,127  prototypes it took before the first model, DC01, would ultimately prove  successful in 1993.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #2296df;">"There are countless times an inventor can give up on an idea. By the  time I made my 15th prototype, my third child was born. By 2,627, my  wife and I were really counting our pennies. By 3,727, my wife was  giving art lessons for some extra cash. These were tough times, but each  failure brought me closer to solving the problem. It wasn't the final  prototype that made the struggle worth it. The process bore the fruit. I  just kept at it."</span></p>
The acceptance of failure, and more importantly, the lessons learned from his failure are indeed what allowed his process to bear fruit.  The DC01 design saved Dyson from bankruptcy and generated a billion-dollar  business. From portable vacs to hand-drying blades in public restrooms — the fruits of  Dyson's failure are all around us.

Though I never really knew too much about James Dyson, I adopted his creed into my own understanding of things, "I just think things should work properly."  I love this motto, because it extends way beyond the physical application.  I think everything should not only work properly, but also professionally and always be of the highest quality.  As innovators such as Dyson and Steve Jobs show us, it is important to never put anything out into the world that you yourself wouldn't believe or invest in.  Equally as important to remember, is that failure is inherent to success.  If you find that you have succeeded without once failing, you've done something wrong.  Failure helps us truly appreciate the value of our ideas, and the blood, sweat and tears that we invest into our endeavors.  And ultimately, failure is one of the key ingredients to making ideas happen.
