Text: We can't tell if he's really a nice guy or not, especially with his "cool", relaxed demeanor and a toothpick hanging out of his mouth, but <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000553/" target="_blank">Liam Neeson</a> does a "nice guy" thing for Joe, a woman to claims to be his first fan ever, by rerecording her voicemail greeting as his character from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0936501/" target="_blank">Taken (2008)</a>.  Watch this clip from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0924651/" target="_blank">Graham Norton Show</a> on BBC.  Oh yeah, Alan Davis and Patrick Stewart are sitting next to him, no biggie.
