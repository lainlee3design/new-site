Text: My brother <a href="http://gobrobot.com">Brobot</a> (aka Landon Lee) and his homies spent the day down in the City on Sunday.  While driving through, they came across these cats tagging a wall and decided to stop and admire!  Brobot grabbed some frsh footage and put together this nice piece with it!  Wonderfully shot, edited, and great music selection!
