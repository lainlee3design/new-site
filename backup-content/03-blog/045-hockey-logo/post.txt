Text: Last week I was very flattered when I was contacted by a gentleman from Sarpsborg, Norway.  He said that he was part of a Spartan Warriors fan club and that their club wanted to use my <a href="http://lainlee3design.com/?type=freebies">Spartan Warrior</a> illo for their new club logo.  The Spartan Warriors are apparently a huge deal in Norwegian pro hockey.  At first, I admired him for showing me the professional courtesy of informing me they'd be using my artwork for their club.  Secondly, I was flattered and felt that I could show a bit of kindness to reward his fan club for their professionalism.  I had a little extra free time, so I decided to hook them up with a proper sports team logo, even if it was just for their fan club.  I made some modifications to my Spartan illo, changed up the colors and added a more sports-oriented type and BOOM - custom hockey fan club logo!!!  Below you can see what they'd sent me as their version and what I came up with.

<a href="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Blllog_Spartan2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1170" title="Blllog_Spartan2" src="http://lainlee3design.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Blllog_Spartan2.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="408" /></a>

I emailed him back with all of the new logo elements and branding and told him to use at their leisure as a way of me saying "thanks".  I never heard back from him and when I checked their website again, they were holding a contest with their club members to see which logo they liked better (only they weren't using my new version of the Spartan, just the hockey sticks and new type...oh yeah, and they reversed the type colors).  Oh well, I guess you can't please everyone, but I still appreciated their honesty in asking my permission!

What do you think of my version of the logo?  Leave your comments below and join in on the convo!
