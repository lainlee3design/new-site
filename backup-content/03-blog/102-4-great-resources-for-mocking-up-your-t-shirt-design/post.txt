Text: So you've done it!  You've designed a slammin' new t-shirt that's so math!  Now what?!?  Well of course, now you'll want to see it on a t-shirt!  But before you pass the design off to your printer or client, or even post your new wears in your online store, you'll want to give everyone a preview of what the finished product is going to look like.  Here are 4 great resources for helping you mock up your next t-shirt design for your customers, printers and clients:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1.) <a href="http://www.shirtmockup.com/" target="_blank">ShirtMockup.com</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The good folks at <a href="http://gomedia.us" target="_blank">GoMedia</a> understand the indie t-shirt game, and have come up with an amazing array of tools for helping out the indie designer or brand owner with mocking up t-shirt designs.  ShirtMockup.com is one of those tools.  Simply log onto the website, choose your t-shirt (either standard or distressed), and upload your artwork.  The magic t-shirt fairies do all of the rest, leaving you with a crisp new mockup you get to save in your desired format.  It's an awesome, quick tool for creating fast mockups, but doesn't allow for much customization (ex. I like to tone down the highlights on GoMedia's t-shirt mockup templates, which you don't get to do here).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2.) <a href="http://mockupeverything.com/" target="_blank">MockupEverything.com</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This is a brand new BETA site from the GoMedia team as well, and I have to say it's pretty fresh!  On the heels of ShirtMockup.com, MockupEverything.com allows you to choose from a variety of apparel, print and tech items to mock up your latest designs with.  It is a paid site though, and getting mockups without watermarks is going to cost you a pro membership of $12.99/month.  It's really too new to tell how useful it will be, but it is a cheaper alternative to buying all of GoMedia's mockup template PSD packs individually.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3.) <a href="http://arsenal.gomedia.us/" target="_blank">GoMedia's Arsenal</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Arsenal is a massive, high-quality collection of vectors, PSDs, and mockup templates from the GoMedia team!  I've purchased several of their mockup templates a few years ago, and they continue to pay for themselves to this day.  The most useful template package for me has been their standard t-shirt mockup package, but they have a wide variety to choose from.  The best feature of their templates is that they are composed of several layers, giving you full control over your mockup.  You can change the lighting, shirt color, drop shadow, contour, etc. all with little to no work at all.  I've customized their templates many times over to suit my needs for my mockups, and I'm asked all of the time, "Where can I get that?!?" because the mockups look that convincing!  They also have mockup templates with models, which could come in handy for some indie brands, though their models aren't very reflective of most indie brands (I could maybe see using them to model band t-shirts or t-shirts for youth groups).  All-in-all, great resources to have in your tool kit, or "arsenal".</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And the best part, GoMedia has PLENTY of helpful tutorials to help you with mocking up your t-shirts!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4.) <a href="http://www.xloadr.com/2010/05/26-free-shirt-templates/" target="_blank">Free Templates</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who doesn't love freebies?  This blog post I found a while ago by <a href="http://www.xloadr.com/" target="_blank">Xloadr</a> features a collection of 26 Free Shirt, Hoody, &amp; Polo templates from around the web you can use in your next mockup presentation.  The biggest problem, they're all flat files (unlike <a href="http://arsenal.gomedia.us/mens-t-shirt-flat-templates.html" target="_blank">GoMedia's T-Shirt Template Arsenal package</a>, which has layers and creates a more realistic mockup).  Still great tools to have if you're in need of a quick mockup template or to give you a less-than-perfect rough idea of how you need to layout your design and how it will look.  My motto is, if it's free grab it, because you never know how long it will be available online (some blog posts featuring freebies have been removed or <a href="http://www.emptees.com/resources/downloads?search=shirt" target="_blank">discontinued</a>).</p>
