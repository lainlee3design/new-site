LainLee3Design is currently running an IndieGoGo campaign to try and raise funds to expand our business!  We are very thankful for how far we've come on our own, but now we're asking you to help us take things to the next level.  Having just made the move to the Bay Area, Ca, we're ready to start exploring partnerships with bigger brands and clients, so that one day we can grow to be a full-grown media agency.  The goal is to raise $10,000 so that we can procure new equipment and supplies, pay for our online services, and get promotional materials made!

There are currently only 13 Days Left!!! Thank you to everyone who has already contributed!
