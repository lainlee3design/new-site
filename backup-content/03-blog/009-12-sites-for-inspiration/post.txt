Text: One of the most frustrating things I can remember when starting out as a  freelance designer over 6 years ago was not having enough sources of  inspiration to draw from, or having ready and reliable sources to go to  for information and help.  But then again, the Internet wasn't the same  in 2005 as it is now.  Now the Internet is literally oozing with  information that newbs can soak up for hours and hours.  But with that  overload of information also comes a lot of gasheads wasting your time  talking about things they don't really  themselves understand, or just  regurgitating, retweeting, and reposting information from more reputable  sources.

With that said, I decided to compile a list for all of you newly  inducted freelance designers out there of reliable sources that I've  come to know and trust over the years for up-to-date information, and a  source of useful tips and tricks.

1.) <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>
Smashing Mag is a go-to source for the web's latest design trends.  This  informative online magazine caters to designers (both print and web)  and programmers, striving to educate and inform through the use of "hit  lists" and showcases.  <a href="http://smashingmagazine.com/">Visit Smashing Magazine</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Smashing Magazine" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmE6Y6Op8I/AAAAAAAAACA/uf2QnEqWeII/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.05+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

2.) <a href="http://tutsplus.com/">Tuts+</a>
<a href="http://tutsplus.com/">Tuts+</a> is a network of tutorial websites from the <a href="http://envato.com/">Envato</a> group.  There are several sites within the network: PSDTuts for  Photoshop, VectorTuts for Illustrator and other vector-based programs,  AudioTuts for sound design and editing, ActiveTuts for Flash users,  NetTuts for web developers and designers, AETuts for After Effects  artists, PhotoTuts for photographers, CGTuts for 3D cg artists, and  MobileTuts for mobile app developers.  The <a href="http://envato.com/">Envato</a> group also boasts probably the single most expansive collection of tutorial-based and informational websites on the net, with <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a> being counted among these.  <a href="http://tutsplus.com/">Visit Tuts+</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Tuts+" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmFZEGfEaI/AAAAAAAAACI/J2QH_ucrE5c/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.19+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

3.) <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a>
From the Envato group comes <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a>, an informational blog catering to freelancers of all kinds.  While I don't regularly use <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a> as a resource for design advice as much, I do frequent the site for  helpful resources, tips, and an occasional chuckle from their comic  strip "<a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/category/freelance-freedom/">Freelance Freedom</a>", illustrated by N.C. Winters.  <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">Visit FreelanceSwitch</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Freelance Switch" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmFoQpUwnI/AAAAAAAAACQ/ac-3gVoLJvA/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.21+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

4.) <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">Freelance Folder</a>
In similar fashion to <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a>, <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">Freelance Folder</a> serves less as a definitive source for information on design, and more  of a source for tips, resources, and helpful advice.  I float between <a href="http://freelanceswitch.com/">FreelanceSwitch</a> and <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">Freelance Folder</a> when searching for new time-management or efficiency advice, software,  or helpful tips on how to maximize my time as a freelancer.  Great for  helping you with day-to-day processes, getting organized, and staying on  top of your business practices.  <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/">Visit Freelance Folder</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Freelance Folder" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmGNEl2jmI/AAAAAAAAACY/coQ8TMqHkY4/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.24+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

5.) <a href="http://designershq.net/">Designers HQ</a>
I'm still fairly new to using <a href="http://designershq.net/">Designers HQ</a> as a resource and inspiration destination, but from what I've experienced thus far, I'm thoroughly satisfied!  <a href="http://designershq.net/">Designers HQ</a> is a place for resources, tips &amp; tricks, and daily inspiration.   It's a mash-up of the resources and advice columns of FreelanceSwitch  and the inspiration of Smashing Mag.  Great source for all of your  advice and inspiration needs with frequent posts and tweets.  <a href="http://designershq.net/">Visit Designers HQ</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Designers HQ" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHEeFaFvI/AAAAAAAAACg/0E9PAA_ovzc/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.26+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

6.) <a href="http://www.noupe.com/">Noupe</a>
Another great resource for finding collections of design tips, tutorials, resources and inspiration is <a href="http://www.noupe.com/">Noupe</a>.   Noupe comes from the good people at Smashing Magazine, so you know  you're getting the same quality and attention to "what's new" as you are  from Smashing Mag.  <a href="http://www.noupe.com/">Visit Noupe</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Noupe" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHVHf7ocI/AAAAAAAAACo/ONsEky2kGr8/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.29+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

7.) <a href="http://thewealthyfreelancer.com/">The Wealthy Freelancer</a>
<a href="http://thewealthyfreelancer.com/">The Wealthy Freelancer</a> is a blog based on the best-selling book of the same title.  The Wealthy Freelancer is an amazing book that I've <em>just now</em> found out about as a freelancer almost 6-years into the game.  Now I'm a  firm believer in everything happening in its time for its reasons, and I  can read the book with 5-6 years worth of experience and still take a  lot from it.  It may be a little overwhelming for newbies, but if I'd  had this resource when I was just starting out, I would've done things a  lot differently I can tell you that!  A great resource to have as a  freelancer and more importantly, as an entrepreneur or self-starter!  <a href="http://thewealthyfreelancer.com/">Visit The Wealthy Freelancer</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="The Wealthy Freelancer" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHiQxP_sI/AAAAAAAAACw/x3UxmUDJJNQ/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.32+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

8.) <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a>
Straight out of Brazil, <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a> puts who they are best on their "about us" page: "Abduzeedo is a  collection of visual inspiration and useful tutorials."  Meaning  "abducted" in Portuguese, <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a> brings a fresh eye to the design game, finding many fresh designs and  awe-inspiring visuals (in all formats) to the table!  A great place for  design junkies who like all types of design: from clean and modern to  raw and edgy.  <a href="http://abduzeedo.com/">Visit Abduzeedo</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Abduzeedo" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHmqFPF2I/AAAAAAAAAC4/Geypsz954Uo/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.35+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

9.) <a href="http://logopond.com/">Logo Pond</a>
<a href="http://logopond.com/">Logo Pond</a> is a great source of  inspiration for logo design, a major part of my business and something  you'll undoubtedly be asked to do at least once if someone finds out  you're a designer.  If logo design is a facet of the industry you're  looking to get into, the <a href="http://logopond.com/">Logo Pond</a> is  a place you should not only frequent for inspiration, but also as a  platform to showcase your work!  New logos are uploaded every day, so <a href="http://logopond.com/">Logo Pond</a> is a ready source of daily inspiration.  <a href="http://logopond.com/">Visit Logo Pond</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Logo Pond" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHoRlTuZI/AAAAAAAAADA/AGyg66qnvG8/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.37+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

10.)  <a href="http://behance.net/">Behance</a>
<a href="http://behance.net/">Behance</a> is probably one of the two  most well-known sources of inspiration on the web right now.  A great  portfolio-based website for not only showcasing your own work but for  checking out what other people are doing around the world!  Some amazing  talents out there to be seen!  Be careful not to lose hours here  though...it's very easy to!  The Behance Network also boasts a fantastic  free project-management application (for web and iPhone) called <a href="http://actionmethod.com/">Action Method</a>.   I actively use Action Method and it's companion book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Ideas-Happen-Overcoming-Obstacles/dp/159184312X">"Making Ideas Happen"</a> on a regular basis and as a way of  keeping ideas in order. Action Method also comes in the form of fresh  &amp; functional office supplies called <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/">Action Products</a>.  <a href="http://behance.net/">Visit Behance</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Behance" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHq6xPB2I/AAAAAAAAADI/YixqXuSIrKQ/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.40+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

11.) <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviant Art</a>
Another website that's been around for a long time and is probably the  second of the two most well-known sources of showcase/inspiration on the  web right now!  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviant Art</a> has expanded their capabilities now, however, to where you can take your  art and sell it as a t-shirt print, art print, or other fun products.  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Deviant Art</a> is also a great place to find free templates for Photoshop and  Illustrator from generous and talented artists who share their work with  the world.  I recently found some great iPhone4 templates there that  have been helpful with mocking up designs for clients.  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">Visit Deviant Art</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="Deviant Art" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHtTCfqyI/AAAAAAAAADQ/NjnDqziPFGs/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.41+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

12.) <a href="http://ted.com/">TED.com</a>
<a href="http://ted.com/">TED.com</a> is a FANTASTIC source for free,  online lectures, but more importantly, it's a FANTASTIC resource for  advice and inspiration.  There is a reason I chose to place TED.com at  #12 on the list, and it's not because it's the bottom.  No, this is  actually the #1 spot on my list, because of what TED.com has to offer.   Many of us don't have the luxury of being able to attend a lot of the  wonderful conferences that are going on where we could network and  talk-shop and hear great minds talk about the things we find interesting  and helpful.  Many of us can't even afford to go to college to hear  stimulating lectures.  Being called "The New Harvard", TED's online  lectures are a jewel, and it would behoove you to take a look at the  hundreds of lectures they have on there.  Each lecturer has 18 minutes  to divulge their souls to the audience (a time limit set by TED's  founder, Richard Saul Wirman (<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>,  Set. 2010 Issue, page 82).  Everyone from designers to architects to  film directors lectures at TED, and it's a great source of inspiration  for anyone looking to be...well...inspired!  <a href="http://www.ted.com/">Visit TED.com</a>

<img class="alignnone" title="TED.com" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_DltEL5XN9P8/TGmHvxiT4uI/AAAAAAAAADY/LIWhey2snZE/s1600/Screen+shot+2010-08-16+at+11.34.42+AM+%282%29.png" alt="" width="600" height="375" />

In summation, this list is in no way comprehensive!  There are hundreds,  if not thousands, of wonderful websites out there for finding daily  inspiration and entrepreneurial advice, tips, and tricks.  What are some  of your favorites?  Which ones did I leave out here?  Leave a comment  with some links and I'll consider including them in my next "hit list"  post!
