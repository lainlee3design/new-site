Text: Ever have the problem where you have a stroke of genius that needs to be jotted, sketched, or chronicled in some way?  It's one of those euphoric moments, where a new idea is like a perishable good that only has minutes before it's spoiled by distraction or over-saturation of too much thinking!  You have to get it down on paper, so you pull out your notebook and reach for your pen.  Wait...where's your pen?  It was there this morning...right...there?  Oh no, where is your pen dammit?!  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHERE IS MY PEN?!?

Yeah, we've all been there.  Thankfully, so have the good folks at <strong>Cleverhands</strong> in San Francisco.  They've developed the Journal Bandolier, a nifty bandito-like strap that holds all of your "school supplies" in a secure, fashionable manner, ON your actual notebook or journal.  Having just purchased my <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/Products/Action-Journal/19">Action Journal</a> from <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/">The Behance Outfitter</a>, I'm carrying my idea book around with me all the time (I subbed the Action Journal out for my usual composition notebook this year) and am always in need of a way to transport my writing/illustration utensils.

The Bandolier is handmade using reclaimed rubber and elastic.  The strap is 2 inches wide and sewn into a loop which measures 5.75  inches long when laid flat. It fits easily around books that run a  little over 5 inches wide such as the Moleskine 5.52x8.25 inch journal  or the Handbook journal of a similar size. Each loop is approximately 1  inch wide. There are a total of 7 loops.  The only problem is that they are one-of-a-kind, so you better hop on over to <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/64357643/journal-bandolier-recycled-rubber-keep">Etsy</a> right away and grab yours today!
