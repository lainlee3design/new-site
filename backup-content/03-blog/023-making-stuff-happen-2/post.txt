Text: It is my goal here on the Blllog™ to entertain and update, but mostly  inspire; to step outside of myself and what I've got going on on a  regular basis to provide you with funny, educational, inspirational  material to get you motivated to make things happen.  One of the ways  I'll be doing that is by interviewing the people that have inspired me  and whom I feel have embodied the "Making Stuff Happen" lifestyle and  philosophy, taking their ideas and dreams to the next level of action  where they become reality.

This week, I had the esteemed pleasure of interviewing an extremely talented musician by the name of <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">Andrew Huang</span></strong>.  Andrew is a 26-yr-old professional musician who has mastered and dabbled in so many different instruments he claims he's lost count.  He goes by many aliases for his music, but he is probably most notable for his pseudonym <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">"Songs To Wear Pants To"</span></strong> or <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>STWPT</strong></span> for short.  <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>STWPT</strong></span> is Andrew's more humorous (more like hilarious) side of his music, serving also as a website where he offers custom song making for anyone who submits a request form and where he keeps everyone updated on his crazy musical concoctions.  He also has a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/songstowearpantsto">YouTube</a> channel under the same name where he regularly posts cleverly-edited videos of his crazy songs.

Andrew's style is really no style in particular, but is instead a vibrant mix of genres, instruments, and voice expertly woven into a tapestry of sound.  He has the ability to switch between genres and styles so effortlessly that each song you listen to is a treat.  More transparent however is his personality, which comes out through his videos whether he recognizes it or not, where he entertains us with a little song, a little dance, and a lot of "behind-the-scenes" footage of what it takes to be a full-time musician (and make those sick videos).

More than anything, Andrew is someone who is making his ideas happen - a solopreneur taking his love for music and making it a reality, a passion, and a livelihood.  Andrew took some time this week to sit down and answer a few questions for me for our first <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>Making Stuff Happen</strong></span> interview on the Blllog™!

<strong><span style="color: #2296df;">L3: Please introduce yourself to everyone out there in the interwebz ;D</span></strong>

<strong>AH: </strong>I'm Andrew Huang, I work with music and video and am best known for my website <a href="http://songstowearpantsto.com/" target="_blank">http://songstowearpantsto.com</a> where I create songs based on instructions sent in by visitors.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: What is your background in music?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>It's  hard question to answer 'cause music has been the biggest part of my  life for most of my life. I grew up learning piano, and at age 12  discovered the bass guitar, and from there music was my main focus. I  would absorb everything about it that I could, whether it was from  instrument or theory lessons, or school, or experimenting and learning  myself, or reading books and magazines... I was very interested in  recording and working with music on computers from a young age as well,  and spent a lot of my spare time on that, starting with tape recorders  and making the eventual move to the digital world. Singing, though I  enjoyed it, was kind of an afterthought for me until my early twenties  when I really started to work on my voice. And composing has been a big  thing for me as well, since I was a kid even...

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: Have you always had a passion for music and entertaining people?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>I  always enjoyed music, though I wouldn't say I was passionate about it  until my early teens. Funnily enough I never thought of myself as an  entertainer - but my family and friends did let me know from time to  time that's what they considered me.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: How did "Songs to Wear Pants To" get started and when did you take the act in front of the camera for YouTube?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>When  I was 19 I couldn't find a job, so I made an eBay posting saying I'd  write a song for the winning bidder. That went way better than I  expected so I did a few more, and within a couple months decided it  could be a fun internet destination if I did some entertaining songs for  free now and then. My roommate at the time coded a site for me, we told  our friends and families and word got around from there.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: You've  got some impressive hit counts on your channels on YouTube man!  When  did you realize that the YouTube thing was a viable way of getting your  name out there?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>I'd  been wanting to get involved in YouTube for a couple years before I  actually did - I was waiting for the cost of good quality cameras to  come down. But it's easy to see what a great resource it is - so easy to  share via social media, lots of visitors running searches on it  everyday, and of course it's free...

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: I love the name "Songs to Wear Pants To", where did it come from?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>It just popped into my head one day when I was 16 or 17 and I tucked it away...haha.

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: What  is it like to make music as a full-time job?  How did you get started  doing that?  Did you have other jobs before or has this been it for you?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong><strong>Songs  To Wear Pants To</strong> took off fast enough that I didn't really have any  jobs before it, beyond the random work that everyone gets in their  teens. It's great that I get to make music for a living. I'm getting to  hone my musical craft in lots of ways every single day. At the same  time, I'm running every aspect of a business by myself, and that's  definitely not something that comes naturally to me. It means a lot of  self-motivation, thinking about promotions, making sure everything is  done on time, answering every email and phone call, reading contracts,  packing merch and going to the post office, etc. That side of things  isn't so fun but it's probably good for me!

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: So  let's talk about some of your music for a minute.  You've got lyrical  skills too man, you're a pretty dope emcee.  How long have you been  rhyming?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>Rap  might have been the first genre I ever tackled. My parents tell a funny  story of this rap I did when I was 4 or 5, just something I made up one  day and would recite now and then but kept adding and adding to it  until it was ridiculously long.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: Are you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/suturesound">Suture Sound</a> first or Songs To Wear Pants To?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>My  priorities change from day to day. I'm hoping I can get to a point  where people are just like "Hey it's Andrew, let's see what his new  stuff is like" - but when you're working with literally every genre you  know of, and doing some stuff that's super slapstick and other stuff  that's serious and heartfelt, I don't know if there's a way to brand it  all together. An audience likes to have at least some expectations.

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: I've  noticed you speak of Jesus in "The Cloud - Peacemaker" and in "Dark  Fantasy" you allude to other spiritual epiphanies in the more dark times  of your life.  Do you consider yourself a spiritual person?  If so, how  has this spirituality influenced your music?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>My  spirituality is one of the biggest influences in a lot of my more  serious music. It affects what I choose to say and the tone of what I do  say, and many of my lyrics do deal directly with my own spiritual  experiences. I still have a lot of things to figure out, but I grew up  in the Christian faith and it played a huge part in shaping who I am.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: How has God then affected your music and life?  Do you feel you have a message to deliver through your music?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>Haha,  that first question is enormous. Let me just say that I spent a long  time trying to ignore God and thinking I knew what was best for myself  and it all went quite terribly. There are a lot of things I want to say  in my music and a lot of ways I want to say them but the overall message  is love, gratefulness, humility, joy, peace, justice... and in the case  of Songs To Wear Pants To, a whole lot of silliness...

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: Tell us a little more about the other endeavors you've got going on, such as your band "Your Heart".</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>Your  Heart is an 8-piece pop/folk/rock band I lead. We're in the middle of  working on a series of albums, one dedicated to each of the four  seasons. Other than that I have a few solo side projects. Girl and  Ghostface Kilobyte are names I use when recording various types of  electronic music, and VS is the name I use for rap. The Cloud is a name I  started using kind of as an everything-else-goes-here sort of deal, and  I'm going to slowly start umbrella-ing more music under that name  because I think it's just getting confusing having so many different  projects. I'm starting to think having one "band" that makes 10  different genres of music is the lesser of two confusions. So eventually  it would just be The Cloud for serious music and STWPT for the funny  stuff.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>L3: One  last question: A lot of creative people struggle with actually making  their ideas or dreams a reality.  What advice would you give to anyone  seeking to become a musician?  How would you advise them to make their  ideas happen?</strong></span>

<strong>AH: </strong>There  are so many things I've learned along the way. Don't be afraid of  failure. Finish what you start as soon as possible. Work on your craft  every day, even when you don't feel like it, and including the parts of  it that are more difficult. Experiment. Learn as much as you can,  however you have to do it. Try new things. Try things that you don't  think you can do. Meditate. Set realistic goals. Ask yourself where you  want to be in five years, figure out as many steps as you can to getting  there, and break them down into smaller and smaller steps until you  have something you can do about it today. Write all this stuff down and  stick to it. Set time aside to work with your creativity.
