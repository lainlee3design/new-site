Okay, well, it's not THAT exclusive, and technically it's not the FIRST look, there have been other <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=10&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEwQtwIwCQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmovies.yahoo.com%2Fblogs%2Fmovie-talk%2Ffirst-set-photos-star-trek-sequel-222928738.html&amp;ei=XvVyULrbLeWqywGbmoHgDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNE6l1RLQA5rWyMYhD7OCSRJudWsww&amp;sig2=vL1lKauQUtwoihxsObeOUw" target="_blank">set photos</a> leaked.  But the other night on Conan, J.J. revealed the FIRST FOOTAGE of the highly-anticipated sequel, giving fans a literal TEASER of what's in store.  Even for only being 3 FRAMES LONG, it looks exciting and FEELS like a J.J. movie!  Weird huh?  Haha, suck it Paramount! ;P
