Text: This past weekend, I had the pleasure of attending the Alameda Flea Market with my fianceé and her dad.  Every 1st Sunday of the month, the now defunct Alameda Naval Base is transformed into an open-air flea market.  For anyone who's ever watched MythBusters, this is the same place where they film a lot of their outdoor experiments, such as the duct tape <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/videos/mythbusters-duct-tape/">potato cannon</a>.  With that in mind now, you can only imagine how large this flea market is.  Because until you've been there and walked the lot of over 800 vendors for yourself, you have no idea how big it is!

Our morning began at 3:45am.  I went primarily as the "muscle", helping them unload the truck and set up, so after my job was done, I decided to walk around and explore since it was my first time attending.  My intention was simply to keep myself occupied for an hour or so while my fianceé and her dad set up their booth.  Once I started walking around however, I began to notice that these vendors had some really cool stuff in their booths.  Not just that, but there were a lot of great vintage items with fantastic design work on them!  Back from a time when things were actually made in America and were made well.  Back when everything was designed with such care and     consideration, such attention to detail.  I just couldn't stop, it     was an ocular adventure and I took so many pictures for visual     inspiration.  Check it out!

I was really diggin' all of the vintage crates.  I think it's so sick how everything used to come in crates, with the branding for the products literally branded into the side of the crate.  It seems like back in the day, companies really took pride in their brand and brand image.  Back then, it was just as much about the name as it was about the product, because they wanted people to remember, "This great product came from a great company."  I think today's world has lost a lot of that brand pride, which is why we have so many terrible, cheap products on the market.  I'm definitely from this vintage school of thought, which is why my products will always be about quality and brand image.

This one vendor was selling a pile of distressed tin letters that drew quite the crowd.  Hey, what's that lady on the right holding up?  Haha, yup!  It's all about the "L" baby!

I really like the simplicity of vintage brands, and how designers back then focused on clean type, bold colors, and minimal designs.  Again, it was all about the brand name and identity - so simple, yet so effective.

Perusing any antiques show or flea market, you're bound to wind up running into a couple of "old friends" - such as He-Man and Teddy Ruxpin!!!

In addition to getting a visual history lesson in design, typography and layout, I also ended up meeting so really nice people.  It's been a great experience for me down here in the Bay so far - I'm loving the diversity, the mentality, and how the most random people end up being really nice!  Big change from where I was at back in Roseville.

Early in the day, I came across a vintage product that caught my eye.  "U.S. Aqua" was a brand of pure drinking water from the 1950s, at the height of the Nuclear Age.  It was processed by the Teasdale Packing Company and could be purchased upon request.  I didn't get to snag some close-up shots of the packaging while I was there, nor did I get to grab this guys name.  But he was really nice, very friendly.  He let me take a picture of the can and even offered to pose with it, haha!  After his cameo, I asked what the product was for.  Not sure himself, we looked at the side of the can and found the following description:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">This can contains water pumper from our own well and immediately  processed under scientific methods resulting in a highly pure drinking  water. Under ordinary storage conditions, this water will keep for  years. IMPERVIOUS TO NUCLEAR FALLOUT. But, in case of fallout, wipe can  and can opener before opening can.  This water is processed under provisions in permit issued to Teasdale  Packing Company by California State Board of Health and meets the  requirements as set forth in the U.S. Public Service Drinking Water  Standards.  Recommended for convenience in emergency uses. It is cheap insurance to have a supply on hand."</p>
Crazy right?!?  "IMPERVIOUS TO NUCLEAR FALLOUT"!!!  You can check out some more great pics of the U.S. Aqua packaging over at <a href="http://www.thedieline.com/blog/2011/8/24/vintage-packaging-us-aqua-pure-drinking-water.html" target="_blank">TheDieline.com</a>.

<span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>Francille</strong></span> was another friendly face from my day.  I'm not even sure what we started talking about, I think I asked permission to photograph something in her booth.  Next thing you know we're chatting up a storm about design!  She was a sweet lady with a warm, inviting smile!  Check out her stuff if you're ever visiting the Alameda Flea Market!

The last two ladies I spoke with were real sweethearts too!  <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>Dianna</strong></span> (left) and <strong><span style="color: #2296df;">Susan</span></strong> (right) from Mariposa, CA have a company called <span style="color: #2296df;"><strong>"Hazel and Ruby's Vintage" </strong></span>where they sell vintage kitchen &amp; garden stuffs, among other things.  I stopped by their booth really intrigued by a vintage sowing machine they had.  Since my fianceé bought her vintage Singer a few months back, I've found myself noticing vintage machines more and how well they're designed.  Anywho, I stopped by and asked if I could snap a few pics of their items.  We talked briefly about how much more detailed things were back in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  We had a few laughs about me taking their picture for The Blllog™ here, but they were really great sports about it all!  If you get a chance and are in need of any vintage home and garden stuff, check out their website at <a href="http://hazelandrubysvintage.com" target="_blank">hazelandrubysvintage.com</a>.  Here are a few more pics snapped in their booth.

All-in-all it what began as a normal outing to the flea market turned into a wonderful, relaxing day full of inspiration and great conversation.  The Alameda Point Antiques Faire &amp; Flea Market takes place on the first Sunday of every month.  For more info, check out their website at <a href="http://alamedapointantiquesfaire.com/" target="_blank">alamedapointantiquesfaire.com</a>.
