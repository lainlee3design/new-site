Description: Kevin Robertson of PocketLabWorks&trade; is probably one of my best clients.  Not just because he always provides me with the most detailed project briefs ever, but also because he continually relies on LainLee3Design to help him with his latest app design.  And though his apps all revolve around a common theme (guitars and amps), Kevin is always coming up with innovative ideas to really push his apps to the next level to give his customers (musicians and enthusiasts) a truly unique experience.  Check out our latest project, endorsed by Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, here!
