Description:
Chris Linn is a wonderful client to work for!  I've worked on several projects for him and each time is a joy.  This time, Chris asked me to help him revamp his website design.  Chris wanted something that updated his current site, keeping the design simple, clean and user-friendly, but also something that updated the feel and alluded to his whimsical style.
