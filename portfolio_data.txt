Lancers is a personal project celebrating the fighting spirit of being a freelancer.

#T10&trade;
- Description
Every so often during your career, you’re approached with a project that you immediately connect with.  T10&trade; (tictactoeten&trade;) was that project for me.  Coming in the form of a multi-platform game of strategy, T10&trade; could very well revolutionize the board game/strategy genre.  The potential for this game is limitless, and it was something that I had to be apart of.  Keep your eye out for big things coming from T10&trade; in the future.
